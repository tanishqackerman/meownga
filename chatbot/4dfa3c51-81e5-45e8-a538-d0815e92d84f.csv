Neku,Outta my face. You're blocking my view.
Neku,Shut up!!! Stop talking. Just go the hell away!
Neku,"All the world needs is me. I got my values... so you can keep yours, "
Neku,I don't get people. Never have. Never will.
Neku,?
Neku,!? What the... I can hear voices in my head! (What just happened?)
Neku,(And where'd this pin come from?) Hmm... (Wonder if there's a
Neku,(This pin... Why do I have it?)
Neku,(Voices! Definitely voices! But why?) ! (Am I hearing people's 
Neku,"! Huh? Whose phone? Mine? ""Reach 104. You have 60 minutes. Fail, and "
Neku,Huh? Still there... It's like junk mail from hell.
Neku,Oww! My hand... Huh?
Neku,!? What?
Neku,! F...frogs!?
Neku,Oww! What the... They attacked me! What do they want with me? D-down
Neku,...Ungh! What the hell is going on!? Somebody! Help!
Neku,Hey... Everybody stop ignoring me! What is this place...
Neku,Crap! I gotta run!
Kariya,"Man, here we go again..."
Uzuki,"Stop whining. We haven't had work in, like, forever."
Kariya,Exactly. It feels like the Monday after vacation.
Uzuki,You'd prefer a permanent vacation? Day 1 has the most Players. Now's 
Kariya,"Aight, aight... One week won't kill me. Probably. Hey, while we're at"
Uzuki,A gaaame?
Kariya,"Yeah, so it doesn't feel so much like work. C'mon, you love it."
Uzuki,"Oh, yeah. You know me. Sigh... All right. What's the game?"
Kariya,"How 'bout Reaper Sport 3, a Player hunt? Let's see who bags the most"
Uzuki,Are you joking? That's no fun at all!
Kariya,You don't like it?
Uzuki,But I'm gonna crush you! There's no contest.
Kariya,"Ohh, zing! Now I have to actually try. You know the drill. Loser buys"
Neku,"Huff, huff... Should be...safe...here..."
Neku,Rrgh... Freakin' frogs! Just leave me alone! I didn't do anything to 
Neku,!? They vanished! Why are people disappearing!? What's happening... Why
Neku,They're gonna get me...
Neku,Huh?
Shiki,You! Forge a pact with me!
Neku,Uhh... I've kinda got my hands full...
Shiki,"Listen! If we forge a pact, we can beat the Noise!"
Neku,Who cares about a little noise?
Shiki,You wanna be erased? Hurry up! There's no time! Make a pact with me!
Neku,A-all right! I accept.
Neku,What's with the lights show?
Shiki,Here!
Shiki,Use this pin!
Neku,But...the funny lights...
Shiki,I'll explain later! Right now we have to stop the Noise!
Neku,Uhh...OK?
Shiki,Get ready!
Neku,That fire... I did that!?
Shiki,Whoa! You can use the pin? You must be really good at psychs. Guess I
Neku,That's what you call those flames? A psych?
Shiki,"Yup. And now that we've made a pact, the Noise won't come after us!"
Neku,"In other words, we're safe."
Shiki,Right. See? All gone.
Neku,All gone. So...What are Noise?
Shiki,They're the monsters we just fought. Duh.
Neku,"(Monsters? Uh, sure... And ""psychs""?)"
Neku,(Is that what this pin is for?)
Shiki,"Anyway, where are my manners? My name's Shiki Misaki. Call me Shiki."
Neku,(I call this wack.)
Shiki,We've got a long week ahead of us!
Neku,A week? Week of what?
Shiki,"The Reapers' Game is seven days long, right?"
Neku,(Reapers? Excuse me? Who is this flake?)
Shiki,So what's your name?
Neku,(Forget her... Where am I? How did I get here?)
Shiki,"C'mon, tell me your name."
Neku,"(The sign says ""Shibuya Station""... Why am I in Shibuya?)"
Shiki,Something wrong?
Neku,(Wait... The intersection. I just need to retrace my steps.)
Shiki,"! Hey, whoa... Wait for me!!!"
Neku,Why are you following me!?
Shiki,Why are you making yourself so hard to follow?
Neku,Screw you. I go where I want.
Shiki,Go where? We're trapped in here!
Neku,What? Don't be stupid.
Shiki,You're the one being stupid. We made a pact. We're supposed to stick
Neku,Survive what?
Shiki,The Game! Don't you wanna win?
Neku,Pfft. Play games on your own time.
Shiki,Hey! That's not funny! They'll erase us if we don't win! You saw what
Neku,No way! Don't make me a part of this.
Shiki,"You're already a part of this. You're a Player, just like me."
Neku,A what? I'm not playing anything.
Shiki,Oh yeah? Then why do you have a Player Pin?
Shiki,Don't you have a timer on your hand? I do...
Neku,What. The. Hell.
Shiki,"See, you're part of the Reapers' Game, too."
Neku,......
Shiki,! We don't have time for this! The clock's ticking! We've only got 20
Neku,"""Ten-Four""? What's that?"
Shiki,"Ten-Four! 104? You got the mail, right? ""Reach 104 or face erasure."""
Neku,(That junk mail...Please. What kind of nut would believe that? Then
Shiki,"Good. Now, for the last time... Tell me your name."
Neku,...... Neku. Neku Sakuraba.
Shiki,"Neku, huh? Cute name."
Neku,(Shut up.)
Shiki,"All right, Neku. Let's go over to 104!"
Shiki,"Hey, Neku!"
Neku,......
Shiki,We have to get over to 104. There's no time!
Neku,......
Shiki,Hey- wait up!!! Neku...
Shiki,I told you! We can't leave!
Neku,"Oh, please."
Neku,Durff! You gotta be kidding me!
Shiki,"Next time, try listening."
Neku,"So this is all part of that ""Reapers' Game""?"
Shiki,That's right.
Neku,(This is nuts. She's actually telling the truth? Then that
Shiki,Neku! Move! We have to get to Ten-Four!
Neku,Oww! It's blocked! There's no way past!
Shiki,We can't get through!? But this is the way to Ten-Four!
Neku,...... (Why do I feel like I'm being watched? That guy over there. 
Reaper,Pact confirmed.
Shiki,What are we gonna do about this wall? [walks past Neku] Huh? Neku! 
Neku,? What's up with that?
Shiki,"No idea. A lucky break, I guess! C'mon, we gotta keep moving."
Neku,(Something about that guy in red...) ! (Huh? Where'd he go? Weird.)
Shiki,Made it!
Neku,The timer vanished!
Shiki,Whew! Mission complete.
Neku,!?
Neku,What!?
Uzuki,Only an idiot would screw up on Day 1.
Neku,Who's there!?
Shiki,"Oh, no... A Reaper?"
Neku,Reaper...
Uzuki,You two are gonna get erased sooner or later. So come on. Help a girl
Neku,Those monsters again...
Shiki,"Neku, you know how to fight now, right? This time focus your thoughts "
Neku,What? Fight your own battles!
Shiki,Please! To stop the Noise!
Neku,...Fine. Come on!
Shiki,Good! Now we can fight together! We can beat the Noise faster as a 
Neku,Is it over?
Shiki,"Not yet, Neku! Over there!"
Neku,(Whew... This one looks though. ...Like I've got a choice.) Hey! 
Shiki,I'm not a stalker!
Neku,Whatever. Just... Don't mess this up!
Shiki,I...I won't!
Shiki,Whew... We did it... But you heard her... Day 1 is nothing. What if 
Neku,(I can't believe this... Why am I stuck here? What if I'm erased!? What
Day,Reapers' Game. Chapter Closed]
Neku,Nngh... ! Where am I now?
Shiki,...I hope this works out.
Neku,Hey!
Shiki,Aaack! Don't scare me like that!
Neku,(Grow up. You're obnoxious...)
Shiki,Umm...Is something wrong?
Neku,Where are we?
Shiki,Isn't this the underpass by the station? I can hear the trains.
Neku,(That's weird. How'd we get here?)
Shiki,There's the mission!
Shiki,"""Set the cursed sculpture free. You have 60 minutes. Fail, and face"
Shiki,Oww!
Neku,Timer's back. What's it for?
Shiki,The mission. ...You really don't know? If we don't clear the mission
Neku,(Sounds crazy to me. But...maybe not that crazy. I saw it happen to 
Neku,Why'd the date change on my phone?
Shiki,A day must have gone by.
Neku,What!?
Shiki,I think we fell asleep after the mission. But that's OK. We need to
Neku,(Have you lost your MIND? It's anything but OK! We were in the middle 
Shiki,"So...this ""cursed sculpture""-- it's gotta be talking about the statue "
Neku,(Maybe we passed out. And then...woke up here? Everything between is a
Shiki,But then what's the curse? ...Neku?
Neku,(Did somebody drag us here? Or--)
Shiki,"C'mon, Neku, pay attention!"
Neku,......
Shiki,"Hey! What, now you're ignoring me? If we don't work together, we'll "
Neku,......
Shiki,You don't have to be like this. Sigh... What am I doing wrong? ......
Shiki,"The ""cursed sculpture"" must be Hachiko. It's the most famous"
Neku,......
Reaper,......
Neku,Where have I seen this guy before...
Shiki,Neku! Hachiko is this way!
Neku,(......)
Shiki,Come ON!
Neku,(Ugh... Go yourself.)
Neku,Oww!
Shiki,What? Another wall!?
Neku,(So now we're trapped in here.)
Shiki,No... We'll never finish the mission now.
Neku,(All she ever does is whine...) ...Why not?
Shiki,Because this is the way to Hachiko.
Neku,(Then we have to get through. We got past the wall yesterday. Is there
Shiki,What should we do?
Neku,......
Shiki,Don't just stand there. Think of something!
Neku,(I AM thinking. Maybe if for just one minute you could stop your bi--
Shiki,"Neku, what is it?"
Reaper,......
Neku,(That guy in the red hoodie. I've seen him before.)
Shiki,Neku. What are you looking at? That guy... You know him?
Neku,"(I remember... He was at the crossing yesterday, by the wall. Who is "
Neku,Something about that guy in red... I'm gonna scan him and see
Neku,[tries to scan the Reaper] ? Hmph.
Shiki,What is it?
Neku,I can't read him.
Shiki,What!? You can't scan him?
Neku,(I had no trouble scanning people yesterday. Maybe the rules changed?)
NekU,(Or maybe the pin is broken.)
Shiki,Can we finish the mission without being able to scan?
Neku,(Hmm... What if it's just him? Maybe he's special.)
Shiki,Neku!
Neku,(Ugh...) What now!?
Shiki,That guy is coming right towards us!
Reaper,You. Scan and erase all the Noise in this area.
Shiki,Huh? What are you talking about?
Neku,(Are those the conditions to move on?)
Shiki,I don't see any Noise!
Reaper,The world is more than just what you see. [he walks off]
Shiki,He left. What a creepy guy.
Neku,"(I don't know what his deal is... But he's part of the Game, that's for"
Neku,"(""The world is more than just what you see."" So to find the Noise...)"
Shiki,How? They're not here!
Neku,Yes they are. We have to scan for them.
Shiki,You think? All right! Let's try it. But first... I meant to ask you.
Shiki,"Shouldn't you try some other pins? You've got more, right?"
Neku,Pins?
Shiki,Yeah! They should've given you a whole bunch.
Neku,(You're right... In my pocket.)
Shiki,Why not test them out?
Neku,How?
Shiki,Remember the flame pin yesterday?
Neku,This one?
Shiki,"Well, I wasn't able to use it. So maybe--"
Neku,I get it. Certain pins only work for certain people. I've got to try 
Neku,(We need to defeat some Noise to proceed. I can see 'em with 
Shiki,"Hey, why don't you try those new pins out? If anybody can "
Shiki,You were right. We have to scan to see the Noise.
Neku,(That takes care of them all.)
Reaper,Objective met.
Shiki,But what about the wall? It's still-- Huh!? It's gone! Why?
Neku,Because we took out the Noise.
Shiki,So that's the trick to getting past the walls. But...that's odd.
Neku,What's odd?
Shiki,I heard you can only beat the Noise in pairs. But I fought them alone.
Neku,"Hmm, me too..."
Shiki,I couldn't see you while I was fighting.
Shiki,!?
Shiki,Huh?
Reaper,The Noise exist simultaneously in two zones. And the only way to 
Shiki,"Wait, but-- What is with that guy?"
Neku,(He knows too much... He must be one of them.)
Shiki,"Well, anyway...You did great."
Neku,What?
Shiki,You were able to use all the pins!
Neku,So?
Shiki,You're like some sort of psych genius!
Neku,(Come on. Using a couple of pins doesn't make anyone a genius. Don't be
Shiki,Huh? Neku. You have two Player Pins.
Neku,So?
Shiki,So why two? You only need one.
Neku,"(How should I know? Why do I have any of them? I need them for psychs, "
Shiki,"Well, umm... Two is better than one! So, like, don't feel bad!"
Neku,(You're the one who said I only need one...)
Shiki,Think how lucky I am! My partner's a psych whiz. A genius! You're a
Neku,(If you're going to flatter someone... you could try to sound a little
Shiki,"Neku, you listening?"
Neku,......
Shiki,Stop that. I'm just trying to be nice.
Neku,I'm listening.
Shiki,"Well, how am I supposed to tell when you just stand there? You should"
Neku,Would you shut the hell up! I just met you. I don't like you. And I 
Shiki,You don't have to yell... What am I going to do? ......
Neku,(Now she's playing with her phone? Forget this.)
Shiki,Hey! Wait up!
Shiki,Where are you going? I'm your partner!
Shiki,! Wha-- Who's there!?
Beat,"You got us good yesterday, but today I'ma crush you, yo!"
Shiki,"Um... What? You've got the wrong person. Neku, you know this guy?"
Neku,Don't insult me.
Beat,Need a hint? Go ask your friends.
Shiki,"""Friends""? What are you talking about?"
Beat,"Shut up, yo! You ain't foolin' me! I can't scan you. You gotta be "
Shiki,Wait! Just--
Beat,What?
Rhyme,See? They've got Player Pins. Players must not be able to scan each
Beat,"...... Oh. Yo, sorry I jumped to conclusions..."
Shiki,No worries. You just gave us a start.
Beat,Yesterday this pink-haired chick cornered us before we could get to 
Shiki,So that's why you were out for payback.
Beat,"Yup. ...Hey, hold up. We should do introductions. The name's Beat. And"
Rhyme,Hello!
Shiki,Hi! I'm Shiki. That over there's Neku. He's my partner.
Neku,......
Beat,Wha's with the phones? He still mad?
Shiki,No...he's just Neku. Don't feel bad.
Beat,"...Hey, I know! Lemme give you a tip to make up for jumpin' yas. You"
Shiki,You mean our cell phones? Well...we don't get any calls... Sending
Rhyme,We played around a bit and found some things--
Beat,"Whoa, you mean you ain't usin' yours? You two gonna get owned down the"
Shiki,Umm... I guess...
Beat,"It's cool! You two got questions, ask us. Gotta put our heads together,"
Shiki,So about the phone...
Beat,Yeah. You can use it to pick out your pins.
Shiki,Pick them out? How?
Rhyme,Well...
Rhyme,Why don't you take this pin? Then you can try it out!
Shiki,We can keep it?
Rhyme,Sure. We had extras.
Shiki,Wow! Thanks!
Shiki,So who's the girl with the pink hair?
Beat,"Heh, that cow?"
Rhyme,She attacked us in the scramble crossing. Those black wings...She's
Beat,"Yeah, we couldn't scan her."
Shiki,"So, it doesn't work on Reapers..."
Rhyme,"Or on other Players, apparently."
Shiki,Guess we found that out the hard way.
Beat,Sorry...
Shiki,"So if she's a Reaper, does that mean she gives out the missions?"
Beat,"Who knows... Yo, that reminds me-- 'sup with today's mission? It don't"
Rhyme,"Yeah, about that..."
Shiki,Do you know anything about the Reaper's Game?
Rhyme,Just that you have to stay alive for seven days.
Shiki,The Reapers send them?
Beat,"Gotta be. It's their Game, right?"
Shiki,"And if we fail the mission, they erase us."
Rhyme,...Maybe not.
Shiki,! Really!?
Rhyme,Beat and I never made it to 104. But here we are.
Beat,So like... we don't gotta play? Sweet!
Rhyme,It's too early to say. We should carry out the missions. I don't want 
Shiki,Hmm... Ours went away when we got to 104.
Rhyme,"Hey, you think you and Neku finishing the mission might've got"
Shiki,What's your take on the mission?
Beat,The cursed sculpture or whatever?
Rhyme,It's gotta be Hachiko.
Shiki,Yeah! That's just what I said! But what's the curse?
Rhyme,Hmm... You got me.
Shiki,We should probably start by heading that way.
Beat,"Can't. There's a wall, yo."
Shiki,Again? What's up with that? We keep hitting these invisible walls...
Beat,"I think we trapped in here, or somethin'. I tried breakin' the walls, "
Rhyme,But some you can get through.
Shiki,Hmm...
Rhyme,We noticed guys in red by the walls we were able to pass.
Shiki,Thanks for all the info! 'Specially about the phone! That's gonna be a
Rhyme,Heh heh. Good! Always happy to help.
Shiki,I feel ready to take on anything!
Beat,"Yeah, well-- you might not wanna say that. Rhyme's thinkin' things is"
Rhyme,They say two heads are better than one. And four has to be better than
Shiki,"Great idea! I am so in! It'll be more fun that way. Right, Neku?"
Neku,...Do what you want. I work alone.
Shiki,"What!? Neku, you can't mean that!"
Neku,Forget it. I can't take one more minute of your nagging. I don't need a
Shiki,Neku! How can you say that?
Neku,(Don't ask me. Maybe I'm just angry.)
Shiki,We're on your si--
Neku,I can't scan you. You could be Players... or you could be Reapers. I 
Shiki,But the Player Pins!
Neku,That's not enough.
Beat,"Yo, Phones! What the hell's your problem!? We just lookin' out for you,"
Rhyme,"Don't get angry, Beat... I can see where Neku's coming from. I "
Beat,"Aw, Rhyme... Rrgh... You piece a' DIRT! Screw you! We don't want your"
Shiki,"Wait, no! We're sorry! ...They left. Nice going, Neku! We should all"
Neku,Then why don't you go with them?
Shiki,"Listen to yourself... We're partners, Neku. But I don't understand "
Neku,Let yourself in. You can scan me.
Shiki,"You know that's impossible! Besides, we're right here. Let's just talk"
Neku,And say what? I'm not opening up to anyone. Ever. Other people just 
Shiki,N-Neku! Sigh... Tell me what I'm supposed to do...
Shiki,"So Neku, have you got the hang of wearing pins? You can't"
Neku,......
Neku,(That guy... Who is he talking to?)
Man,...Tell me what's ailing you. ...We're not all made of stone.
Neku,......
Shiki,Neku. Give the man some space...
Neku,......
Reaper,......
Neku,(Another guy in red. We must be headed towards a--)
Shiki,Ouch! A wall.
Neku,(I knew it.)
Shiki,"So... We just have to defeat some Noise, right?"
Neku,(She is so SLOW! Do I have to do everything?)
Shiki,Neku! Where are you--
Neku,I know what you are.
Reaper,My terms: Lift the statue's curse.
Neku,You're a Reaper.
Reaper,I don't get paid to chitchat. Play the Game.
Neku,"(Hmph. That was a waste of time. Lift the statue's curse, huh? That"
Shiki,"Please, STOP walking off without me!"
Neku,Hey.
Shiki,"Arrgh! My name is Shiki. Can you say ""Shiki""?"
Neku,"Hey, I see another statue."
Shiki,Oh yeah! The Moyai!
Neku,Like Easter Island? What's a Moai doing here?
Shiki,"""Moyai""! With a Y! Never thought about where it came from..."
Neku,Think it's cursed?
Shiki,I don't know. It looks pretty normal to me.
Neku,Let's find out.
Neku,So we need to lift the statue's curse. Which means that Moai-
Shiki,Mo-YAI.
Neku,(Whatever. Let's check it out.)
Shiki,Noise!?
Neku,"That must be the curse. Maybe if we erase all that Noise, we can lift "
Shiki,Neku!
Neku,"I know, I'll take care of it. The Noise buzzing around the "
Reaper,Objective met.
Shiki,So the Moyai was possessed by Noise... and we had to scan to find it.
Neku,(The guy in red... Yup. He's gone. But we can probably get through 
Shiki,We freed the cursed sculpture. Does that mean we cleared the mission?
Neku,"No, that was just to cross the wall. See? My clock's still ticking."
Shiki,"Yeah...mine too. Well, at least the wall's gone."
Neku,"Let's go find this ""Hachiko""...Our real target."
Shiki,Neku... You talk like you've never heard of it.
Neku,Nope. What's Hachiko?
Shiki,WHAT!? How can you live in this country and not know Hachiko?
Neku,......
Shiki,Remember where we met yesterday? There's a statue of a dog in the 
Neku,......
Shiki,Not again...
Neku,......
Shiki,...... All Right! Fine. Let's just head for Hachiko.
Shiki,"C'mon, Neku. Let's head over to Hachiko!"
Man,...Oh. ...You're all better now! ...I'm so glad.
Neku,"(He can tell!? In a way, that's pretty impressive.)"
Man,...Hey. ...Hachiko seems down lately. ...Don't you think?
Neku,"(Hachiko is feeling down? Does that mean it's cursed, too?)"
Higashizawa,...... That young lady... She has just the ingredient I need.
Shiki,We made it! And with plenty of time left!
Neku,(This is where we met yesterday... So the two places are connected.)
Shiki,OK! Let's lift Hachiko's curse!
Neku,And how do you propose we do that?
Shiki,"Well...umm... Maybe we could erase the Noise around it, or...yeah."
Neku,(She's clueless. This is why I can't count on other people. ...They're
Shiki,"Hey, I bet Hachiko's possessed by Noise, too. Scan the "
Neku,(But doesn't that seem too... easy?)
Neku,No Noise around the statue...
Shiki,You tried scanning? Then Hachiko must not be cursed?
Neku,(Could we have the wrong statue?)
Shiki,"Huh? Hey, look, Neku!"
Neku,(Crap...We don't have time to hunt for another statue...)
Shiki,EARTH TO NEKU!
Neku,What!
Shiki,Something's wrong with Hachiko.
Neku,Like what?
Shiki,Hmm...I'm not sure. But it looks different from when I saw it at Hachi
Neku,Then let's take a closer look.
Shiki,Hmm... Something about him seems different.
Neku,(Let's get a closer look.)
Shiki,"Hmm...Something is definitely off. When I saw him at Hachi Fest, "
Neku,(I should get a closer look...)
Shiki,Hmm...Hachiko seems less...lovable?
Neku,What's Hachi Fest?
Shiki,"Oh, it's a blast! It's this festival where you touch Hachiko "
Neku,Wow. Charming.
Shiki,"They hold it every year. And each time, the place you have to"
Neku,...You explode?
Shiki,You get cursed!
Neku,Hmm... Sound pretty extreme.
Neku,So this cure... 
Shiki,Umm... I know something's off...
Neku,"(Well, you just take your time. Cause, you know, we've got so much of "
Neku,"So, Hachiko's curse..."
Shiki,Why don't we start scanning around? Somebody else may know
Guy,...Hey. ...Hachiko seems down lately. ...Don't you think?
Neku,(What is it with this guy and statues?)
Guy,...He must be like you. ...Drifting in a sea of woes... ...If only I 
Neku,Polish away Hachiko's pain? That's...idiotic.
Shiki,"Hey... Neku, we should try that!"
Neku,Try WHAT?
Shiki,Polishing! Hachiko did look a little dirty. And I saw this weird 
Neku,"(Or what if someone just went crazy with a magic marker? Well, if "
Shiki,Yeah!
Shiki,Yes! Now we can free Hachiko from the curse. Let's hurry 
Neku,(...Do you ever shut up?)
Shiki,"What should we do, Neku?"
Neku,(I might be missing something... I should gather more info.)
Shiki,"OK, Neku! Let's polish like we mean it!"
Neku,Isn't that gonna...you know...create a scene?
Shiki,Don't worry! No one's watching. And so what if they see us?
Neku,(See us petting a piece of ROCK?) All right. Whatever...
Shiki,"OK, Neku, let's polish like we mean it!"
Hachiko,Grr...
Shiki,"You say something, Neku?"
Neku,Nope.
Shiki,You know... It seems the more we polish... the less this looks like
Hachiko,GRRRRR....
Shiki,Stop growling and polish!
Neku,I'm not growling...
Shiki,"Neku, something came out of the statue!"
Shiki,"Neku, we did it! The timer's gone! So there was Noise possessing both"
Neku,And our mission was to get rid of both.
Shiki,"Hey, Neku..."
Neku,Yeah?
Shiki,You said before you don't need any friends.
Neku,Yeah. Your point?
Shiki,"Well, you couldn't have solved Hachiko's riddle without me."
Neku,What? Get real.
Shiki,"If I hadn't noticed the pattern, we might not have cleared the "
Neku,"Listen, Stalker. I don't need you to solved one stupid riddle."
Shiki,"Riiight. Well, if you ask me--"
Shiki,!?
Shiki,Huh!?
Neku,That voice... You were at 104 yesterday!
Shiki,You're that Reaper!
Uzuki,"Well, excuuuse me for doing my job."
Shiki,Then it's true?
Neku,(A Reaper... She gives out the missions?)
Uzuki,"You know, you owe me a bowl of ramen. For not disappearing like you're"
Neku,(This...girl is a Reaper?)
Uzuki,"What's wrong? Too spooked to answer? Well, this should bring you "
Shiki,Huff...huff...
Neku,(Nngh... These Noise are tougher than the others...)
Uzuki,"Wow. You're, like, stronger than I thought. But I'm not done playing"
Neku,(No... I can't keep this up... I've got one chance.)
Uzuki,Hmm?
Neku,(I have to take her out!)
Uzuki,Please tell me you're not planning on fighting me? Ha ha ha ha! How
Neku,(What!? She erased her own Noise?)
Uzuki,You seem surprised.
Neku,Aren't the Noise on your side?
Uzuki,"Eww, gross! Don't group us together. The Noise are nothing but tools."
Neku,(Rrgh...I can't let this brat win! But can I stop her? I have no idea 
Shiki,"Don't, Neku! You don't want to take her on! She can erase you in a"
Neku,Hmph.
Uzuki,"Aww, what? You're giving up? Booo-ring. Don't get my hopes up like "
Neku,Huh!?
Uzuki,But...I can't do that.
Neku,(Huh?)
Uzuki,"Well, this is a pickle... Hmm... I know! Let's try something fun! A"
Neku,You...you will?
Uzuki,"You betcha! Sweet deal, huh? So, like, what do you say?"
Neku,(A ticket out...)
Shiki,"Neku, don't! Don't listen!"
Uzuki,"You back there. Shut up! Now, are you in, or are you out?"
Neku,...I'm in.
Shiki,Neku!
Uzuki,"Whee! 'Atta boy! Now, let's get started. Oh, I forgot to mention. If "
Neku,What!?
Uzuki,Thankfully the rules are veeery simple. You have one minute...to erase
Neku,What? Erase her?
Uzuki,"Yup. Poof! Kaput! Easy, right? Just pretend you're erasing the Noise."
Neku,(W-wait! Dammit... She's asking me to kill someone. There's no way I 
Shiki,Neku...
Uzuki,30 seconds! Still on the fence? Then let me give you an incentive. 
Neku,What? She's a spy?
Shiki,Hey! What are you saying!
Uzuki,Thanks for checking in so often. We couldn't have done it without you.
Shiki,Shut up! Don't lie! Neku...She's making all of this--
Neku,Your phone. Why did you keep playing with your phone?
Shiki,Huh!? Oh... I was...just...
Uzuki,Just SPYING. She's not very good at covering it up.
Shiki,I didn't spy! I swear!
Uzuki,"G'bye. And thanks for playing. 10 seconds... You're the star, kiddo."
Neku,......
Uzuki,What are you waiting for? Do what comes naturally. Save yourself. 
Shiki,"Don't, Neku. Don't kill me..."
Neku,I have to.
Shiki,Please...don't kill me.
Neku,I have to
Day,Don't Kill me. Chapter Closed]
Neku,"Nngh... ! What is this place? It's dark... Is it nighttime? No, I'm"
Neku,...... I need to get out of here. Where's the exit?
Neku,If I use this pin for a light... ? Huh? It doesn't work. So I can't use
Neku,! (Footsteps? Somebody's coming this way...)
Neku,Show yourself!
Shiki,Ahhh!
Neku,You?
Shiki,Neku!? You scared the crap out of me! Don't do that.
Neku,I scared YOU? Where the hell have you been?
Shiki,It was dark. I was looking for a way out! I must've tripped a half a
Neku,"(Hmm, time to try this again.)"
Shiki,"Neku, pins only work when we fight Noise."
Neku,Really?
Shiki,Well...with a few exceptions.
Neku,(Like psychokinesis...) W-well...It's dark. You should be more careful.
Shiki,You kidding? I already found the exit!
Neku,Then why didn't you lea--
Shiki,I'm not going anywhere without you.
Neku,......
Shiki,"C'mon, I'm not that useless, am I?"
Neku,...... Don't do anything dumb like wander off.
Shiki,Excuse me? Which one of us has been acting dumb?
Neku,.......
Uzuki,What are you waiting for? Do what comes naturally. Save yourself. 
Shiki,"Don't, Neku. Don't kill me..."
Neku,I have to.
Uzuki,Now let's see some results!
Uzuki,! Who are you?
H,"Ah-ah-ah, sister. You gotta play by the rules. Making ""erase your"
Neku,It is!?
Uzuki,I know that. I was just having a little postgame fun.
Neku,What!?
H,One mission per day. That's the rule. And only the Game Master can 
Uzuki,"I know that, too! But I'm not the Game Master. Which MEANS this wasn't "
H,"Then start walkin', sister. Your work's done for the day."
Uzuki,...Hmph. For a Player... you know a lot about our rules.
Neku,You...you tricked me! All that about letting me out of the Game-- that
Uzuki,"Like, that is so rude! I do not lie. If I erased you, that's still"
Shiki,"Thank you so much. We owe you our lives, Mister...um..."
H,Hanekoma. Sanae Hanekoma. Think of me as a sort of...guardian. I watch
Neku,That Reaper tricked us.
H,You mean she tricked YOU.
Neku,......
H,"You ignored the young lady, fell into a trap, and very nearly snuffed"
Neku,......
H,"If you think you can do everything yourself, you're in for some hard"
Neku,'Scuse me?
H,Hard feelings don't make for good teamwork. You wanna survive or not? 
Shiki,......
Neku,...... ...Sorry.
Shiki,"Neku... I, um... F-forget it. I'm over it. I mean, you didn't... She"
H,"There! Problem solved! Now listen up, you two. There's only one way to"
Neku,"""Phones""?"
H,"You know what trust is, right? Partnership is essential to surviving "
Neku,......
H,You won't sync up unless you OPEN up. Talk to her! Tell her how you're
Shiki,"He's right, Neku! Look...I know I hold you back. I'm not that good at"
Neku,......
Shiki,Neku?
Neku,"I want to understand me, too... But I don't."
Shiki,What...
Neku,I can't remember anything but my name. I woke up in the intersection 
Shiki,But... That means...what? You have amnesia?
Neku,......
H,"Sorry to hear it, boss...That's rough."
Shiki,I can't believe you've lost your memory... You could've told me 
Neku,I didn't know.
Shiki,It did strike me as kind of strange that you knew nothing about 
Neku,"What, like you do?"
Shiki,"Well, I don't know EVERYTHING, but... Anyway. We got lucky. Thanks to"
Shiki,Ahhh! That almost gave me a heart attack!
Neku,"Hey, you dropped your phone--"
Shiki,Ahh! Don't touch it! I got it!!!
Neku,(Nice photo.)
Shiki,...You looked?
Neku,The screen was face up...
Shiki,That's my friend. She was in my class.
Neku,So all those times--
Shiki,Yeah. I was looking at this.
Neku,And you yell at me for keeping secrets! It's just a photo. You don't 
Shiki,"Look, Neku! The mission mail!"
Neku,(...Huh? She's covering? What else does she have to hide?)
Shiki,"""Defeat the master of A-East. You have 360 minutes. Fail, and face"
Shiki,Oww!
Neku,The timer. Guess we'd better get started.
Shiki,OK! Today's mission has something to do with A-East.
Neku,? A-East?
Shiki,It's the name of a concert space. I've been there a bunch of times.
Neku,You seem to know Shibuya pretty well.
Shiki,Of course! I hang out here all the time. Follow me! I'll take you to
Shiki,First things first.
Neku,(The exit.)
Shiki,!? Wait a sec...
Neku,What now?
Shiki,"Umm... We're here, heh heh..."
Neku,You mean we were inside A-East the whole time? You know--
Shiki,How was I supposed to tell? They had all the lights off!
Neku,......
Shiki,"We're ahead of schedule, so no griping. Now let's go defeat that "
Neku,It was too dark to see anything inside.
Shiki,Then we better take care of the lights. Otherwise we're more likely to
Neku,How do we restore power? (Somebody around here must know...)
Neku,We won't get anywhere without light.
Shiki,Let's do some recon. I bet somebody around here can point us
777,"Tsk, the hell is he? We gotta rehearse."
Neku,(What's that guy grumbling about?)
777,"Hey, perfect! You two."
Neku,! Huh?
Shiki,Can we help you?
Neku,H-h-hey! Wait a sec--
777,Think you could do a guy a favor?
Shiki,"Sure, if we can be of any help."
Neku,Shh! What're you--
Shiki,Let's hear him out. Sometimes all people need is a good listener. We
Neku,(You sap... Look at the bigger picture!)
777,"My band's supposed to play here in a few hours, but the tech's been gone"
Shiki,So this tech's part of the concert crew?
777,That's right. He's in a black tee. Got a lanyard 'round his 
Shiki,Why can't you go find him?
777,'Cause I got a concert. I can't go wondering off. The name's 777
Shiki,777...
Shiki,"777... ! No way! Like 777, ""Def Märch"" vocalist and rising"
777,"Oh, you've heard of us? Rock on. We're still totally indie. But"
Shiki,"Whoa, are you all right?"
777,"Yeah, my throat's just sore. I had to shout a lot during load-"
Shiki,"Oh, you poor thing.."
Neku,"(No tech, no show, huh? So if we find the guy...) You can rehearse if "
777,"Of course! It's that, or call off the show. So how 'bout it? Will you "
Shiki,"We want to help, but... We don't really have time...do we?"
Neku,......
Neku,"Sorry, but we've got stuff to do."
777,"It's cool. I'm sure you're busy. Just, if you see him? Tell "
Shiki,All right. We will.
777,Thanks!
Neku,(...Is that her idea of saying no?)
Neku,"Sure, we'll do it."
Shiki,What? We will!?
Neku,Yup.
777,"Thanks, man! You rock! If you see him, tell him to haul it back to"
Neku,OK.
Shiki,Hee hee!
Neku,"Ugh, stop laughing."
Shiki,"Sorry, I've just never seen you act so...nice."
Neku,"(...She still doesn't get it.) If the tech comes back, he can turn "
Shiki,"Oh... Duh! Neku, that's brilliant!"
Neku,"Plus, that 777 guy? He's a--"
Shiki,Now we can help 777 AND finish the mission!
Neku,(Sigh...)
Shiki,A black tee and lanyard... I don't see anyone like that 
777,I'll be here waiting. Thanks again!
Reaper,...... Want past this wall? Then here. Defeat the Noise!
Shiki,Another wall.
Neku,No big deal. We know how to handle it now.
Shiki,! Hey! Why don't we try that pin?
NekU,"Oh, the one Mr. Hanekoma gave us?"
H,"OK, Phones! In honor of your growth as a human being, and a friendship"
Neku,"(OK, but... First, could YOU remember my name?) Um, Mr. Hanekoma. It's"
H,"! Oh, right! Sorry, Neku. My bad. I got it now."
Neku,(I wonder.)
H,So let's start with some Q & A. You got questions? I got answers.
H,"To win the ""Reapers' Game""... you must complete seven missions, one "
Shiki,"So...is it true that if we don't, we'll be erased?"
H,"Well, only if you fail, to be precise."
Shiki,Huh?
H,You two aren't the only Players. If any one Player completes the
Shiki,Then we don't have to play.
H,"Ah, but if you all think like that and ignore the missions--"
Neku,Then we all wind up erased.
H,"Furthermore, the Reapers grade the Players."
Neku,Grade us?
H,"Naturally, you get points for finishing a mission."
Shiki,But...what are the grades for?
H,"On the seventh day, you'll know. Just clear the missions. You'll be "
Neku,What are Reapers?
H,"Their main job are running the Game, and testing the Players. So like"
Shiki,She was such a creep...
Neku,So they're like some kind of group?
H,"Yes! Very sharp, Phones. You've seen the guys in red, by the walls?"
Neku,(I knew it.)
Shiki,"Whoa, really? But the guys by the walls never attacked us."
H,Not all Reapers are cut from the same cloth. Some are Harriers; others
Shiki,So they don't fight.
H,"The Harriers, on the other hand, hunt Players for a living. It's not"
Neku,So we're their lunch.
H,"Everybody's gotta eat, kiddo..."
Neku,Mr. Hanekoma...Who are you?
H,"What, me? Pfft... ...... All right. I'll tell you a little. The name's"
Neku,I didn't ask for your personal ad.
H,"I'm a big gambler. My favorite word: ""windfall."" ""Natto"" gets my tummy"
Neku,Like I said--
H,"As for my physical dimensions,"
Neku,Stop. Please.
Shiki,So you run a café? I thought you said you were a guardian.
H,"The café's like a hobby. Totally hip, right?"
Shiki,Yeah! I think it's cool.
Neku,(Uhh...what?)
H,Drop by my place if you get the chance. I'll give you the best cuppa 
Neku,(What kind of invite is that!?)
Shiki,"This...IS Shibuya, right?"
H,You bet. But not your Shibuya. It's an alternate Shibuya we call the
Shiki,"""UG""?"
H,"As in ""Underground."" The UG is one big chessboard for the Reapers' "
Neku,You expect us to believe that?
H,"The Shibuya you came from is called the RG. The ""Realground."""
Shiki,So we're in another world?
H,No... The RG and UG exist in the same space. What you see is the RG--
Neku,......
H,The UG is run by the Composer.
Neku,Who's that?
H,Shibuya's supervisor.
Neku,Shibuya has a supervisor? Right.
H,"I can't say anything more on that subject. It's classified, you dig?"
H,"Now, for that gift I promised..."
H,In honor of you two making up!
Shiki,What is this pin? It's blank. What it's psych?
H,This one's a little different. It takes two people to use. It only 
Shiki,Yeah! You're great at psychs. Way better than me.
Neku,You think?
H,"There, see? You take good care of that."
Shiki,"Let's try and get to work, Neku!"
Neku,...... (But...I can't use it by myself. I'm supposed to sync up with 
H,Just to be clear... You need more than talent to use that. It takes
Neku,"I'll use it. And please... My name is Neku. Not ""Phones."""
H,"! Oh, right! Sorry 'bout that. I got it now, Phones!"
Shiki,"He was quite a character, huh?"
Neku,(And really bad with names.)
Shiki,"What a nice guy, giving us that pin. And fun to talk to."
Neku,I'll give you that. (Something about him just...pulls you in. Not sure
Shiki,Neku! Let's try the pin!
Neku,"...... (So I have to sync up with her? Pfft, right.)"
Shiki,"What's wrong? Oh, I know. You forgot how it works, right? You're"
Neku,......
Shiki,"Let's see... First, we have to fight in sync."
Neku,(And that's where this all goes to hell.)
Shiki,"Then, once we've got a groove going, this pin will activate, and you "
Neku,(Great explanation.)
Shiki,Ready to give it a shot?
Shiki,What? You're not going to fight?
Neku,I'm not ready.
Shiki,All right. No rush.
Shiki,OK! Here goes nothing!
Neku,...... Come on.
Shiki,"So, did you get the hang of it? Or do you want to practice some more?"
Shiki,If we work together... we should get a ton of use out of this!
Neku,......
Reaper,Objective met. Wall clear!
Shopkeeper,Welcome.
Neku,! Huh!? I thought no one could see us!
Shiki,"What, did you forget, Neku? It's like Mr. Hanekoma said."
Shiki,"Inside places with that decal, we become visible so we can do some"
Neku,Oh yeah...
Shiki,I don't see anyone with a black tee and lanyard.
Neku,He might be indoors.
Techie,"Man, screw the concert. Can't they hire another tech?"
Shiki,"! Psst! Neku, did you hear that?"
Neku,Yup. Looks like we found our man. Guess he's on strike. (He picked the
Techie,"I'm tellin' ya, I've got stage presence! I'm not the behind-the-"
Doi,"Well, just remember, son. The future is a clean slate, and you're "
Ken,"Now have a hot bowl of ramen and cheer... ...up? Hey, where'd he go?"
Shiki,Neku! The tech just took off!
Neku,What? Dammit! I don't care if I have to DRAG him back to A-East!
Techie,Whew...I just can't deal anymore. Wish I could curl up and forget all
Shiki,Wow. Talk about your negative vibes. He'll never come back with us 
Neku,"Yes, he will. He has to."
Shiki,He seems so down. I wonder what's on his mind...
Neku,"Dammit, what is he DOING? We need to restore the power."
Neku,!? Hey! He's surrounded by Noise!
Shiki,You're right! It's like he's possessed!
Techie,"Man, now I feel all out of whack. It just gets worse and worse."
Shiki,We should erase the Noise around him.
Techie,"Huh? What am I doing here? ! Oh, crap! Look at the time! I gotta get"
Shiki,Good. Now he'll head back.
Neku,"And once he does, we'll have power."
Shiki,"Pretty weird, though, the way he snapped right out of it."
Neku,Yeah... You think the Noise are out to hijack people's minds?
Shiki,But then what about last time? Remember? They erased the people they
Neku,(Maybe they're like the Reapers--not all cut from the same cloth. Or
Shiki,"Well, either way, they're not good for you! If we see anyone else"
Neku,"(OK, Captain Sappy. Roger that.)"
Shiki,"C'mon, let's drop by A-East. The tech should be back by now."
Shiki,Now we can get some light. Back to A-East!
777,The hell you been? Go get us ready for rehearsal!
Techie,"I'm sorry, 777... But...the stage lighting's busted."
777,"It's what? How're we gonna rehearse--no, how're we gonna PLAY THE SHOW!?"
Techie,I got a repairman working on it. That's why I was out--to pick up the
777,Great! Then we're ready to rock.
Techie,Huh?
777,"You got the part, right?"
Techie,"Umm... Define ""got""..."
777,You nimrod! Go get the part. Move it.
Techie,Right away!
Shiki,Uh-oh... More trouble?
777,Hey! Domo arigato for findin' the tech!
Shiki,"You're welcome, but... Something wrong?"
777,"Yeah, sounds like our lightings on the fritz. The guy just went hunting"
Shiki,Guess we're gonna be in the dark a while longer.
Neku,Think the tech's got it covered?
Shiki,...Maybe we should check on him.
Shiki,Think the tech's got it handled?
Neku,He went north when he took off...
Shiki,Maybe we should check up on him.
Reaper,...... Want past this wall? Then beat two of these-- where I can see
Neku,"Noise symbols are those things we see when we scan, right?"
Shiki,And we need to erase the kind in his picture.
Neku,OK... Let's get cracking.
Neku,OK! I think we took out the right Noise.
Shiki,Me too. Let's hurry up and open the wall!
Reaper,...... Objective met. Wall clear! [Wall is lowered]
Shiki,"! Hey, look! It's Beat and Rhyme. Let's go say hi!"
Neku,...... (Why? We're not at a party. What a pain in the rrgh...)
Shiki,"Look, see? Beat and Rhyme are right over there. Heeey!"
Neku,Ugh...
Shiki,Beat! Rhyme!
Beat,"Heh. Talk about crap for luck, yo. Here comes Phones."
Rhyme,Gathered any intel for the mission?
Shiki,"No, not at all. But I know we'll get through it! We just have to take"
Rhyme,But then what's this meme for?
Shiki,"""Meme""? What's a ""meme""?"
Beat,......
Rhyme,"I think Shiki could use our help. We can tell her, right?"
Beat,Well...aight. But only 'cause it's Shiki.
Shiki,"So what's a ""meme""?"
Rhyme,Memes are words or ideas related to the missions. Whenever we see or
Shiki,Blackout? ! Huh? I just got mail... You're right. It showed up on my
Rhyme,They're for imprinting.
Shiki,What's your take on today's mission?
Rhyme,"You mean, ""defeat the master of A-East""?"
Shiki,We were there. It's pitch black. You can't see a thing.
Rhyme,Pitch black? Hmm... That might explain the meme...
Shiki,So memes are for imprinting.
Neku,Meaning...what?
Rhyme,Oh. Imprinting's one of the Player Pin's powers. You can use it to 
Neku,(This pin can do that? )
Rhyme,Oh yeah! When you imprint--
Beat,"Yo, forget it, Rhyme. Don't bother. Phones don't trust us anyway."
Rhyme,"Beat, don't be like that. A problem shared is a problem halved, right?"
Shiki,"Ahh! No, no! There's nothing to worry about."
Beat,"C'mon, Rhyme. Le's bounce."
Shiki,Hmm... Beat's still mad... I wish we could patch things up.
Neku,(Why? Just leave him alone. Quit worrying about everybody else.)
Shiki,"Well, at least we know how to imprint memes now. That was nice of "
Neku,But what's the point?
Shiki,"Well, umm..."
Man,Ahh... What should I do?
Neku,!
Man,Considering the circumstances... But...no...that won't do.
Neku,What's tearing that guy up?
Shiki,"It looks like he can't make up his mind. ! Hey! Neku, why don't we try"
Neku,OK... Why not? Let's give it a shot.
Neku,...So. Want to try imprinting on that guy?
Shiki,Yeah. We need to find out what it does!
Man,Ahh...What should I do? Considering the circumstances... But...
Man,...Hmm! Bah. It's no use. Why pretend I have the
Man,(Ahh...)
Man,"(No matter what I do, it never seems to work out. "
Man,"! ...Blackout? A blackout... That's right! First... I need to,"
Neku,Is that guy gonna be OK?
Shiki,"Well, we know how it works now. We'll work on finesse next time."
Neku,(Is this really gonna help?)
Techie,Man... What do I do? What was that part I need a replacement for? I
Shiki,"Hey, isn't that the tech?"
Neku,"Yup. Full of fail, as usual."
Shiki,Neku!
Neku,I know. I'll try imprinting.
Shiki,Neku! Let's try imprinting on the tech! It might jog his
Techie,Man... This sucks. What was that part I need a replacement for? I 
Techie,Sigh... I am so gonna get yelled at.
Techie,(Arrgh... I can't remember.)
Techie,"(The guy would know, But I can't wander back now... What "
Techie,! (Blackout...?) Oh yeah! I gotta fix the lighting. And to do that... 
Neku,The guy? Was there somebody by the stage?
Neku,Who's this guy the tech mentioned?
Shiki,Was there someone fumbling around inside A-East?
Neku,"If so, let's hope he has a better memory than the tech."
Shiki,How are we gonna find anybody in the dark?
Neku,We don't need light to scan.
Shiki,Hey... Good point! What are we waiting for?
Guy,I can't believe he's not back yet! How long could it possibly take to
Neku,...A fuse? Is that what the tech's after?
Shiki,That has to be the part he needs. What do you say we give 
Techie,Man... This sucks. What was that part I need a replacement for? I 
Techie,(Arrgh... I can't remember.)
Techie,(! ...Fuse?) The fuse! I have to fix the lights. And I need a new 
Techie,I have to hurry!
Neku,And away he goes.
Shiki,Maybe he'll buy the part now. Or maybe he won't... We'd better follow
Shiki,Look! He just went inside.
Neku,Let's move.
Techie,Thank you! You saved my life! I'll never forget this!
Shiki,Whew! He finally bought what he needs.
Neku,Now maybe we can get some light.
Shiki,"We should head back, too."
Shiki,"Maybe, finally, we'll get some light! C'mon, back to A-East!"
777,Quit playing around!
Techie,"Wait, wait-- I got the part!"
777,Damn right you do! Now fix the lights!
Techie,Eep!
Shiki,That should do it!
Neku,Finally we can see inside.
Shiki,Yeah. C'mon!
Shiki,"Now we can face A-East's master! But, um... who or what is "
Neku,"Once we face it, we'll know. Just don't let your guard down."
Shiki,I...I won't!
Shiki,Huh? Still no power...
Neku,What's busted now?
Shiki,"If the repairman's still in the back, he would know."
Techie,What's the story?
Repairman,This should about do it...
Techie,All fixed?
Repairman,Yup! Try flipping the breaker.
Techie,OK! Here goes!
Repairman,Hmm? No good...The power blew again.
Techie,What!? Why? I thought you fixed it!
Neku,What's wrong now?
Shiki,I dunno... Maybe the fuse wasn't the problem.
Neku,!? Wait! Something's in here!
Shiki,Huh!?
Neku,It's coming! Get ready!
Shiki,"Geez! Talk about a heart attack! But...that was the master, right?"
Neku,Nope! Clock's still ticking!
Shiki,You're kidding! Then...where's the master!?
Neku,No! We're out of time!
Beat,"Don't drop the ball now, yo! Here's your ""master""!"
Shiki,Beat! Rhyme!
Beat,"Yo, looks like we made it."
Rhyme,Yup! The timer's gone now. Mission complete.
Shiki,But...I'm so confused...
Repairman,Huh? It's fixed!
Techie,You sure?
Repairman,Uh-huh. The lights should work now.
Techie,"OK, I'm gonna go tell the others!"
Neku,Looks like they're in business.
Rhyme,This place is gonna fill right up. We should step outside for now.
Shiki,"Oh, so taking out the giant bat wasn't enough! Whoops. Good thing you"
Beat,"Man... You two shoulda gathered more info, yo. I'm talkin' to you,"
Rhyme,Hee hee...
Beat,"What, Rhyme?"
Rhyme,"Stop trying to act tough, Beat. We didn't have all the info, either! "
Neku,Let me guess. We had to beat the big golden bat first.
Beat,"Bwaaah! Yeah... You act like you got the answers now, but you was"
Rhyme,"So were you, Beat."
Beat,"Bwaaah! Whose side you on, yo?"
Shiki,Ha ha ha!
Rhyme,Hee hee.
Beat,"Least I got the job done, aight?"
Neku,...Heh.
Beat,"Hey, I heard that, yo! Who said YOU could laugh at me?"
Shiki,Look. The concert's starting. Wait...
Beat,'Sup now?
Shiki,"How come we were able to talk to him? You know, 777."
Neku,'Cause he's a Reaper.
Shiki,WHAT!?
Neku,Mr. Hanekoma explained all this. Did you forget?
H,Now listen up. This Shibuya ain't your Shibuya. It's the Composer's
Shiki,So we're basically invisible?
H,Only those involved in the Game can see you.
Shiki,"So...the Players, the Reapers, and...you?"
H,Right.
Neku,Why am I even in this stupid game?
H,All Players come from the RG to the UG for a common reason. And each
Neku,What we value most?
Shiki,Do we get it back?
H,If you win.
Neku,...And if we don't?
H,"You lose your entry fee forever. And-- well, your right to exist."
Shiki,That's right... He mentioned only Reapers and other Players can see 
Neku,......
Rhyme,You think... You think we'll make it?
Neku,We'll make it.
Rhyme,!
Neku,No matter what!
Beat,"Heh. Think you can deliver, Phones?"
Shiki,"Hey, you know... we really do make a good team. Starting tomorrow, "
Rhyme,I agree! And what doesn't kill us only makes us stronger.
Beat,"If Rhyme's down with it, then so am I."
Shiki,"No objections, Neku?"
Neku,(How can I object? I still don't know anything about the UG... Or about
Shiki,"Hey, Neku. Remember what Mr. Hanekoma said."
Neku,"(""Trust your partner."" I remember. And now I see why. What else can I"
Shiki,Yay! That settles it. Here's to teamwork!

Megumi,"Six? My, my..."
Konishi,"That puts us at the 50% erased mark, one full day earlier than"
Megumi,"Higashizawa's doing nicely, then."
Konishi,"Yes, sir. That concludes today's report. We have our regular meeting"
Megumi,Right. Good work. Heh...

Konishi,"Tick, tock, Minamoto. You're 9 minutes and 42 seconds late."
Minamimoto,"Tick, tock, yourself, Konishi. Why are we even here? I can think "
Konishi,"You will address him as ""Mr. Kitaniji."""
Megumi,It's fine. Are we all here?
Minamimoto,"Hey, Megs-- Who's the bulldozer?"
Megumi,Meet Higashizawa-- this session's Game Master. He'll be handling my
Higashizawa,"You do me a great honor, sir. Watch! I will turn this week's"
Minamimoto,"You planning to erase them, or EAT them?"
Megumi,"Yes, crack your jokes. But his skill is proven."

Minamimoto,"Cooperation is garbage. Anyway, I'm out. This is subtracting from "
Konishi,Wait just a-- Mr. Kitaniji hasn't spoken yet!
Megumi,Let him do what he wants.

Neku,Yawwwn... Where am I now?
Shiki,"Hey, you awake?"
Neku,What are you doing?
Shiki,"Just people-watching. I mean, look at them all... Shibuya's so "
Neku,(Shibuya sucks. Who needs a town with this many people? All they do is
Beat,"But yo, you ever try scanning 'em all? It's like havin' the radio on"
Rhyme,Yeah... Like everybody's values are all trying to come in the loudest.
Shiki,Shibuya's a battlefield.
Neku,(Yeah...It is kinda like that. A clash of creeds.)
Beat,"But man... All these people, and they can't even see us, yo."
Rhyme,"Yeah... Makes you sad, huh?"
Neku,(Sad!? I'm thankful. Nobody sees me. Nobody bothers me. And nobody

Shiki,Nothing the four of us can't handle!
Rhyme,Yeah!
Beat,"""Reach Towa Records. No time limit. Fail, and face erasure. --The"
Shiki,Huh? No time limit? But...that's waaay simple!
Rhyme,Towa Records is a ten-minute walk. Why wouldn't they set a time limit?
Beat,"So we're just walkin' a couple blocks? Man. I was pumped for a brawl, "
Neku,Guess we don't need to team up.
Rhyme,......
Neku,(But this is too weird. Hundred yen says they've got something else up
Beat,"Yo, hold up! I jus' got a great idea!"
Uzuki,"Like, what gives, Kariya!? Who made today's mission for ages 3 and "
Kariya,"Aight, easy, girl. Deep breaths. Stress is bad for your complexion."
Uzuki,"Well, excuse me! Easy missions make me furious! Ugh. I need to go"
Kariya,"Whoa, let's think about this. Put yourself in the Players' shoes."
Uzuki,Hmph... Point taken. Guess the boss thought it through.
Kariya,'Sides... Days off are like love letters from the higher-ups. We 
Uzuki,Please. Since when does your dial even GO to full blast?
Kariya,"Details. Anyway, we've got our own orders straight from the boss."
Uzuki,All right... You win. Let's see how this plays out.
Shiki,I wonder what Beat's great idea is.
Neku,Don't get your hopes up. (The real mystery is today's 
Beat,...Yooo! Where you goin'!?
Shiki,What's up?
Beat,"Like I said, I got a great idea!"
Shiki,Yeah?
Shiki,So what's your great idea?
Beat,"How 'bout you two race us two, and we see who gets to Towa Records "
Neku,Whaaat?
Beat,"C'mon, Rhyme, le's book it!"
Rhyme,"Wha...huh!? Wait, Beat!"
Shiki,"Heh heh... Beat's got a lot of energy, huh?"
Rhyme,"Yeah. He keeps me on the ball. Sometimes he can get a little crazy,"
Shiki,"Wow, so you-- ! Omigosh. Rhyme, is that what I think it is?"
Rhyme,Huh? What?
Shiki,That pendant! Where did you find one?
Rhyme,"Oh, this? Yeah, I heard they sold out quick. How'd you know about it?"
Shiki,I saw it in a magazine. I looove following the latest clothes and
Rhyme,I'm sorry I can't give you mine. But it was a present from my brother.
Shiki,You've got a brother?
Rhyme,Yeah. Older. He's really nice. Hope he's OK...
Shiki,"Oh, I'm sure he's doing great. And you'll see him soon!"
Rhyme,Yeah... I hope so. So you're into fashion?
Shiki,Totally! I want to be a designer. I love making clothes. But right now
Rhyme,I still think it's pretty cool. It must be nice to have a dream-- to 
Shiki,Why not? You don't have any dreams?
Rhyme,No... But when I look at Beat I think: keep moving forward. Because
Shiki,Yeah.
Rhyme,Beat's really good at skateboarding. He says his dream is to be the
Beat,"YO, RHYME! Whatchu doin'? Move it! We don't want Phones to win!"
Rhyme,"Just a minute, Beat! Patience is a virtue! Well, I'd better go. See "
Shiki,Whoa! Beat's just a speck now. Rhyme must have a rough time keeping 
Neku,(I'll say.)
Shiki,"So, um, shouldn't we hurry?"
Neku,"I never agreed to race. If he wants to run, good for him."
Shiki,Then we can slow down for a bit?
Neku,"Sure, why not? There's no time limit, and those two have got a head"
Shiki,So...we can take a little side trip?
Neku,Where are you going with this?
Shiki,Mind if we stop at Ten-Four?
Neku,...I guess not.
Shiki,Really? Thanks!
Neku,"So... Why do they call it ""Ten-Four""?"
Shiki,"You mean 104? Isn't it obvious? Break it into two numbers, "
Neku,...Who thought that was a good idea?
Shiki,Hey!!! Neku! I said I want to go to Ten-Four!
Neku,Ugh... It's a zoo in here. Are they having a sale or what?
Shiki,"No, silly. Ten-Four's always like this. Ah! Omigosh! That outfit!"
Neku,Is that the line--
Shiki,You don't know how badly me and Eri-- ...... Sorry... Me and my friend
Neku,(...Friend? The girl on her phone?)
fangirls,IT'S HEEEEEEM!
Neku,!? Noise!?
Shiki,Hey...Over there!
Nao,The prince looks sooo hot!
Mina,I gotta snap a photo with my phone!
Neku,Oh. Not Noise... Just noisy. Who is that guy?
Shiki,Eiji Oji. The Prince of Ennui? He's the latest superstar. People love
Neku,"""F Everything""? What kind of blog is that?"
Prince,"Hmm? You, young man!"
Shiki,Huh?
Prince,What are you doing in Ten-Four if you can't even coordinate an 
Neku,(Who the... Sigh.) Trends?
Shiki,"Yeah, you know. Like what brands are hot?"
Peincw,"Ah, the blessed voice of wisdom. At least one of you knows how to"
Shiki,I have to! Shibuya is every girl's war zone.
Neku,Good thing I'm not a girl...
Prince,You should know a trendy outfit can turn a pigsty into the loveliest 
Neku,(Arrogant snob. I am not...a...a spicy tuna roll!)
Shiki,"He's right, Neku. As long as we're here--"
Neku,"Oh, no. Count me out. I don't care about trends. I wear what I want to"
Shiki,"Ugh, no, you can't do that! They call it a fashion statement for a"
Neku,(Then I wish I had more zippers...so I could tell you to ZIP IT.)
Shiki,"Look, you've got potential. You could be sooo much cooler. And I KNOW"
Shiki,"Well, I'm not going to force you. But your clothes... They're, um..."
Neku,WHAT?
Shiki,"Ahh! Nothing, nothing! Just forget I brought it up. ......"
Neku,"(Suddenly, I feel naked.)"
Neku,So what's so great about trends?
Shiki,Oh! Changed your mind?
Neku,'Course not. I'm just asking.
Shiki,"Well, Shibuya's kind of unique. Trends here change really quickly. And"
Neku,Better how?
Neku,I don't need help being cool.
Shiki,"I know what I'm doing, Neku. I've been studying fashion bit by bit, so "
Neku,No kidding.
Shiki,I've always liked to sew. I started with little things like stuffed
Neku,So the one you're always carting around-- you made that?
Shiki,"Yup. The clothes I've got on, too."
Neku,Seriously!? Wow. They look like what you'd buy in a store.
Shiki,"Heh, thanks. But the clothes, I just sewed them. Eri did the design."
Neku,(Eri? Oh. The girl from her phone.)
Shiki,I still have a lot to learn. But one day...
Neku,So that stuffed animal is your creation.
Shiki,"I...I made him a long time ago, so he's not very good."
Neku,Why do you still have it? Stuffed animals are for kids.
Shiki,Shut up! This is my psych! How else am I gonna fight off the Noise?
Neku,That...is your psych? ! You mean... you use that piggy as a weapon?
Shiki,He's not a pig! He's a cat! Mr. Mew the cat!
Neku,"""Mr. Mew""? (How old is she? Three?)"
Shiki,"Look, I only know how to use tele...whatever."
Neku,"Telekinesis? OK, but why a stuffed animal? Couldn't you pick something"
Shiki,"I tried. But Mr. Mew was the only thing that worked. Besides, I'm not"
Neku,Umm... That's not telekinesis.
Shiki,Hmm... I guess not.
Neku,(The pig moves on its own? What if it's possessed-- waiting to pork-
Shiki,"I know he turned out awful, but... without him, I never would've "
Neku,"So, a fashion designer, huh?"
Shiki,Yup! I want to make clothes for a living. Nice clothes make people
Neku,(Hmph. She's got her whole future planned out. Never woulda thought.) 
Shiki,"Heh heh, I try. But I still have a ways to go. There's so much to "
Neku,Cool. (I didn't give her enough credit. She's got a dream. That's more
Shiki,"Pay attention to the trends from now on, Neku."
Neku,......
Shiki,"OK, let's head to Towa Records. Beat and Rhyme are probably waiting."
Shiki,Neku... Beat and Rhyme are waiting. Let's head over to Towa
Neku,Why? He wanted to race. Let him wait.
Shiki,Umm... Don't you think that's a little unfair to Rhyme?
Neku,......
Shiki,"Hey, Neku... Hold up."
Neku,What?
Shiki,"When I scan, sometimes I see this weird green symbol. Wonder what it "
Neku,"Green symbol? ...... Hey, you're right. Reminds me of a pig."
Shiki,Hmm... And the pig indicator on my phone is lit. Hey! Remember? The
Neku,You mean the Pig Noise?
Shiki,He said Pig Noise always drop pins.
Neku,Uh-huh.
Shiki,"So, like, shouldn't we go fight them? Free stuff!"
Neku,Big deal.
Shiki,Plus the pins you're wearing will get stronger from fighting. It's a
Neku,...Right.
Shiki,"Good, it's settled. Let's take those piggies out!"
Reaper,"...... Want past this wall? Bring me two 1,000 Yen pins. Noise No. "
Neku,We need those pins.
Shiki,Yeah. But there's no guarantee Noise will drop them.
Neku,Feeling lucky? We could try leveling down.
Shiki,Leveling... what?
Neku,Here-- I found this feature on my phone.
Shiki,OK! We got the right pins. Let's have him open the wall.
Reaper,Objective met. Wall clear! [Wall goes down]
Shiki,"Ahh, enough! Just looking at you makes me cringe!"
Neku,What did I do!? (What's gotten into her?)
Shiki,It's coming loose.
Neku,"Umm... (What, your grip on reality?)"
Shiki,Neku... That button on your shorts.
Neku,"Oh, yeah. What does it matt--"
Shiki,It matters! I can't stand things like that!
Neku,Who care's? It's just a button.
Shiki,Off.
Neku,What?
Shiki,Your shorts. Take them off! I'll fix the button.
Neku,Are you high!? I'm not taking my pants off in front of you-- in the
Shiki,"Oh, grow up. What, are you going commando? You're invisible! No one's"
Neku,YOU'RE watching!
Shiki,Now! Pants! Off!
Neku,Doooooon't!!!
Shiki,"There. All done! Whew, I feel much better. Loose buttons drive me "
Neku,That was... fast... You always carry around a needle and thread?
Shiki,Of course. They come in handy. Plus I enjoy sewing. If you need 
Neku,...... (Will I have to strip again? ...... I'd better take care of my
Reaper,...... Want past this wall? Bring me five 500 Yen pins.
Shiki,He wants a lot of pins...
Neku,Let's try doing some mass Noise reduction.
Shiki,"Um, how does that work?"
Shiki,Whew... That should be enough pins. Now he'll open the wall 
Reaper,Objective met. Wall clear!
Shiki,"Oh, hey! There's Beat and Rhyme."
Beat,"The hell you been, yo? This is a race! Ain't you even tryin'?"
Neku,Nope. You're on your own there.
Beat,Ain't you angry you lost? Don't you wanna WIN?
Neku,Don't YOU? Why did you wait for us?
Beat,We... We was just...
Rhyme,Hee hee... Beat said we should let you catch up.
Beat,"Bwaaah! Yo, Rhyme, can it!"
Shiki,"Aww, Beat's a big softy underneath!"
Beat,"Shh...Shiki! Not you, too! I...I just wanted to see Phones squirm, "
Neku,Uh-huh. Consider it eaten.
Beat,"Heh heh! C'mon, Rhyme. Le's bounce!"
Rhyme,"W-wait, Beat! You're going to trip if you don't slow down!"
Shiki,She's so lucky to have her best friend as a partner.
Neku,Guess you should've teamed up with that friend in your picture. 
Shiki,But... I couldn't... We're... ...... 
Neku,?
Shiki,Come on. We should go.
feet,A trap. Rhyme pushes Beat out 
Shiki,Wh-wh-what just happened!?
Kariya,Awww! There's goes my erase streak. He was supposed to be number 16.
Neku,Reapers?
Kariya,Bingo! I'm Koki Kariya. And this is Uzuki Yashiro. There. Now that
Beat,Hey! What did you do with Rhyme?
Uzuki,Um...hello? You just saw. She's gone. Erased. Noise food. Game over.
Kariya,Her soul's just another speck of Shibuya space dust.
Shiki,No...Rhyme's gone...for good?
Beat,You... You did this!?
Uzuki,"Yeah. But, like, so what? That's our JOB. Boss said set a trap, so we"
Beat,Your job? Screw your job! Murderers! You... You erased Rhyme!!! Give 
Kariya,"Ooh, scary. Go on, Skulls. Be the star of your little soap opera. But"
Beat,I-I didn't--
Kariya,"Well, Skulls, Jr. knew. That's why she protected you. Gave her life "
Beat,Rhyme is gone... because of me?
Uzuki,"Awww... Boo hoo. But don't worry. You won't suffer for long, hee hee!"
Beat,!? Noise!? You punks can make Noise?
Kariya,Bingo! All you need is some Soul and a pin to bind it to.
Uzuki,"We'd looove to take you on ourselves, but attacking Players directly "
Kariya,So! Our work here is done... Time to call it a day.
Uzuki,Buh-bye. Nice knowing you.
Kariya,"Oh, yeah. One last thing, Skulls. You want payback? Then man up, huh? "
Beat,"HEY!!! Get back here you son of a... Dontchu run from me! Dontchu run,"
Neku,"Hey, we gotta get rid of this Noise."
Shiki,Yeah. Otherwise...
Neku,Start with the smaller Noise!
Neku,There. That just leaves the big one.
Shiki,Right!
Beat,"Dontchu touch it, yo."
Shiki,Huh?
Beat,This one's mine. This bastard took Rhyme from me. Get in my way and 
H,Don't be stupid!
Neku,Who- who's there?
H,You're down a partner. How you think you're gonna take on the Noise?
Beat,"Like I care! Butt out, yo! I gotta avenge Rhyme!"
H,You mean waste her sacrifice! You're powerless. Accept it! Rhyme left
Beat,Rrgh... My life's over anyway. You jus' said so.
H,There's a way to keep you alive. But you have to come with me. Now!
Beat,"Why should I live when she can't, yo?"
Shiki,"Beat, go with him. Rhyme would want it that way."
Beat,But--
Neku,We'll handle this.
Shiki,"She was our friend, too."
Beat,Ahhhhhh....
H,Listen. You may be alone. But there's still a role that only you can
Beat,Grrraaaaaah!!! ...Fine. But you better kill that bastard dead. Avenge
Shiki,Well... We're alone again. Think Beat'll be OK?
Neku,Mr. Hanekoma's with him. He's fine.
Shiki,But...he only had three minutes to live.
Neku,So what were we supposed to do?
Shiki,I don't know... Why couldn't we save Rhyme?
Neku,Because we couldn't. That's how it was meant to be.
Shiki,How can you just write her off like that!? Don't you care? Aren't you
Neku,Yeah? Like what? (Dammit...I feel like crap. This is just like that
Shiki,How dare you! You think NOT teaming up would have saved her? How can 
Neku,Then who needs 'em.
Shiki,Huh?
Neku,Who needs friends! They laugh and talk like idiots and pretend to agree
Shiki,Neku! I am your friend. So is Rhyme--
Neku,Back off! No one's my friend. Least of all you. I just stay with you to

Neku,Unnh...Where am I?
Shiki,Hey. You awake? ...... The mission's not here yet. ...... Looks like 
Neku,(That I was no better than a Reaper... Rhyme... ...... Well. Right
Shiki,Yeah. You're right. For Beat.
Shiki,"It's here! The mission! ""Free Spain Hill from the Noise. You have 200"
Shiki,Oww!
Neku,The timer. Free it? Then we have to erase some Noise.
Shiki,Spain Hill's right over there.
Neku,Then let's get going.
Reaper,...... Want past this wall? Then wipe out two of this area's largest
Shiki,The way to Spain Hill is blocked.
Neku,Then let's give the guy what he wants.
Shiki,"OK! The biggest Noise symbols, huh?"
Neku,OK... We did what he wanted.
Shiki,Let's have him clear the way to Spain Hill.
Reaper,...... Objective met. Wall clear! [Wall is lowered]
Shiki,"So we just have to clear the Noise out of here, right?"
Neku,Let's get started.
Shiki,So many Noise.
Neku,If that's our mission...
Shiki,"I know, I know. Let's start picking them off!"
Shiki,Huff...huff... This isn't working...
Neku,We're not even making a dent. Why do more Noise keep showing up?
Shiki,You think something is drawing them here?
Neku,"If so, we'll have to strike at the source. (...Wherever that is.)"
Mina,"C'mon, Ai. What's wrong?"
Shiki,!! Neku. Look! Those two girls that just left the restaurant...
Mina,"Ai, are you mad at me?"
Ai,Don't be ridiculous.
Mina,You...you sure?
Ai,Yes! OK?
Neku,Whoa! Look at all the Noise! What's up with those two?
Shiki,Looks like they're having an argument-- and that's drawing all the
Neku,I think we found our source.
Shiki,OK. Let's try getting rid of the Noise around them!
Neku,We need to take out the Noise possessing those two.
Shiki,Right!
Neku,(They've gotta be the source of all those.)
Neku,That takes care of those Noise.
Shiki,No... Look! Here come some more!
Neku,Crap. This will never work.
Shiki,"Those two keep drawing more in. What's their story, I wonder?"
Mina,"Hey, Ai, are you free around this time next week?"
Ai,...... Probably. Why?
Mina,N-nothing. Forget it.
Ai,......
Shiki,"Whoa, feel all that negativity?"
Neku,! What if that's attracting the Noise?
Shiki,Huh?
Neku,Remember last time? The Noise hijacked the tech because he was jealous.
Shiki,"Hey, you're right... But these two don't look possessed. They're "
Neku,If we help them patch things up--
Shiki,The Noise will stop coming! Brilliant! Let's try it!
Neku,First we have to figure out what's wrong...
Shiki,So... How do we help them patch things up?
Neku,"Sounds like a job for imprinting, if you ask me."
Shiki,Good idea! Let's start by hunting down some memes.
Makoto,"OK! Enough self-pity. I have a job to do, and I'm going to "
Neku,"(Uhh...first, you need to do your job.)"
Makoto,I'd better hunker down and check the pavement!
Neku,...Classy.
man,"Where is all this merchandise coming from? First ""Reaper"
Neku,? What's up with that guy?
man,Reaper... Creeper...
Neku,Is he having a stroke?
Shiki,Hmm...It looks like some kind of divination. See how he put that ten-
Neku,You mean where HE moves it. It's not gonna move on its own.
Shiki,Unless we play a little trick. Think you could use your psychs to give
man,White! Go to White!
man,"White! An answer, clear as day! Nothing beats Reaper Creeper "
Neku,...Let's move on.
Shiki,Let's.
Ai,Mina... You really didn't go to Shibu yesterday?
Mina,"I...I didn't. I swear! Quit asking, Ai."
Ai,"Sure, whatever."
Ai,(She is so lying... ! ...Reaper Creeper? Of course! Why didn't I think of
Mina,Hmm? What's up?
Ai,"Ever heard of ""Reaper Creeper""?"
Mina,"Reaper Creeper... Oh, yeah! That magic game people were talking about "
Ai,Wanna try it?
Mina,Sure! Sounds like fun!
Shiki,They're going to use Reaper Creeper... Neku. Should we fake it?
Shiki,Yeah... We may want to get our fact straight first.
Mina,"Hey, Ai, you sure this isn't phony?"
Ai,Very sure. I saw it move yesterday!
Mina,"OK, then. Let's give it another try."
Shiki,"OK, let's move the coin and rig the answers. If we want them to patch"
Neku,Ai needs to know the truth.
Shiki,What!? But...that's really risky. Ai suspects Mina. She thinks Mina is
Neku,Exactly. That Mina girl is lying. And Ai is gonna find out eventually
Shiki,Well... I don't know...
Neku,Lying isn't right.
Shiki,......
Ai,"OK, Reaper Creeper has a few rules."
Mina,Like what?
Ai,"First, someone has to summon the Reaper."
Mina,"Ooh, let me do it!"
Ai,...All right.
Mina,Reaper...Creeper... Before we get in much deeper... If you're here all
Mina,Go to White!
Mina,"White! Cool... The coin really moved! So, like... We said, ""if you're"
Ai,That's right. And they can see right through a lie.
Mina,Scary!
Ai,"All right, Mina. Next question."
Mina,What are you gonna ask?
Ai,Hmm... Why don't I ask about you?
Mina,About m-me? Why?
Ai,"(Because I'm onto you, you tramp. You and Makoto.) Reaper...Creeper...If"
Ai,"Mina has a crush on someone, doesn't she?"
Ai,Aha! White!
Mina,"Um, Ai--"
Ai,(White means YES. She's got a crush. And I saw her with him yesterday. 
Mina,Ai... This isn't like you.
Ai,REAPER. CREEPER. If Mina has secrets that should be brought to light...go
Ai,"You're hiding something from me, aren't you!?"
Ai,Aha! See! White!
Mina,Please...Ai!
Ai,I knew you were hiding something!
Mina,...What?
Ai,"This is it, Mina! Last question!"
Mina,"Ai, please stop..."
Ai,REAPER. CREEPER. Yesterday Mina met with Makoto. And she LIED to me about
Mina,"! What? Ai, you knew about that? Aww... You saw us?"
Ai,Yes! I know all about you. You and Makoto and your little--
Mina,Here.
Ai,"What... Two tickets? How could you, Mina... You knew I liked Makoto."
Mina,I'm sorry. I just wanted to help.
Ai,...What?
Mina,Makoto wants to go to the Molco slam-off. But he couldn't get a ticket.
Ai,"Oh, Mina. You didn't..."
Mina,You and Makoto go have a great time.
Ai,You got them for me?
Mina,"Yup! Now you can put the moves on him, hee hee."
Ai,Mina... I'm so sorry... I totally got the wrong idea...
Mina,No worries. It's partly my fault for fibbing to you. We're friends.
Ai,...Yeah.
Shiki,Neku! The Noise are thinning out.
Neku,Good! Let's finish the job.
Neku,"So, the Noise feed on negativity..."
Shiki,Neku!
Neku,Let's finish the last of the Noise.
Shiki,Right!
Neku,Timer's gone.
Shiki,"Whew! Mission complete. Looks like Ai and Mina made up, too."
Ai,"Hey, let me take you out to eat. It's the least I can do."
Mina,Really? Awesome! How about sundaes?
Ai,Sure! Let's hit that family restaurant up the street.
Mina,OK!
Shiki,Aww... See how nice it is to have friends?
Neku,(No.)
Shiki,"Sure, you may butt heads now and then, but life is more fun that way."
Neku,"(Fun? Right. Every time you argue, you end up meeting halfway and "
Shiki,"...... Neku...You don't lie to MAKE friends. I agree, that wouldn't be"
Neku,...... (Her and that photo...)
Shiki,"Hey, Neku? Yesterday you said we were better off without friends. You"
Neku,......
Shiki,Eri used to do everything for me. There was nothing she COULDN'T do. 
Neku,I thought that pig of yours was the reason.
Shiki,He's a CAT! Ugh. Anyway... She saw me making Mr. Mew. And then she 
said,"       ""Wow, you're really good with a needle."" So we got talking, and she "
Neku,......
Shiki,"Meeting her, talking to her, getting to know her... Admiring her... It"
Neku,......
Shiki,Rhyme said she didn't know what dreams are like. And now she never
Neku,"I know... I...I'm sad, too. We'll just have to live a little extra. For"
Shiki,Yeah. If we get a second chance.
Neku,! Second chance?
Higashizawa,"Hello, young lady."
Shiki,! Who's there?
Neku,A Reaper!
Higashizawa,Correct. But not just any Reaper. I am Yodai Higashizawa... Game
Neku,Game Master... So you're in charge?
Higashizawa,Correct again.
Shiki,Then Rhyme is gone because of you!
Higashizawa,I detest leftovers. No Players were meant to escape yesterday's
Shiki,......
Higashizawa,Because you are strong. It's a dog-eat-dog world. A logical
Shiki,How dare you! Rhyme protected Beat! You call that weak? Take it back!
Higashizawa,"I admire your courage and loyalty, young lady. Delectable. This"
Higashizawa,Heh heh... I see I've sunk my teeth into something good.
Shiki,We'll never lose to you! You'll pay for what you did the Rhyme!
Higashizawa,"Sadly, I've had my fill for the day. I only came here to meet "
Shiki,Me? ...Why?
Higashizawa,"To get a closer look, of course. At the charcoal-black envy"
Shiki,I...I don't understand.
Higashizawa,"Oh, don't you, though? You can't fool me. You know the feelings"
Shiki,!?
Higashizawa,"Oh, how deeply you must hate yourself. You have EXACTLY what you"
Shiki,......
Higashizawa,No one loves you. You can't love yourself. And so the jealousy
Shiki,Stop it!
Higashizawa,That friendly sugar coating can't sweeten the selfishness inside
Shiki,No...I'm not--
Higashizawa,You are. And you know it. Why else would your entry fee be--
Shiki,Stop! Don't say it!
Higashizawa,Heh heh... That complex of yours is a bruise on the tomato of 
Shiki,"No, I... I'm just..."
Higashizawa,Nothing will change if you are restored to life. You'll just go 
Shiki,No... Please don't...
Neku,Restored to life? What the hell are you talking about!?
Higashizawa,You're dead. Didn't you know?
Neku,I'm... I'm dead?
Higashizawa,"All the Players are. The Reapers' Game is an examination, to see"
Neku,......
Higashizawa,"Now, if I may be excused... See you on Day 7. Keep it fresh. "
Neku,I'm... I'm d-d-dead? How? When did I... I'm DEAD!?

H,Now listen up. This Shibuya ain't your Shibuya. It's the Composer's
Neku,So we're basically invisible?
H,Only those involved in the Game can see you.

H,Right.
Neku,Why am I even in this stupid game?

Shiki,"""Dominate the view""? ...No idea."
Neku,(Wow. Thanks for giving it all that thought. What's gotten into her?)
Shiki,The scramble crossing at three o'clock?
Neku,Is something scheduled to happen? Or do we make it happen? Let's start 
Neku,We need to make sense of this mission.
Shiki,......
Neku,"...... (Um, right. I'll let you know how that goes...)"
Makoto,Sigh... I'm done for.
Neku,(What's that guy mumbling about? I can feel time slipping through my
Neku,Three more hours? ! (It's noon now...so in three hours... it'll be
3,00!) Hey! I think this guy might be the key!
Shiki,......
Neku,"(T-talk, dammit! Why is she so quiet today?)"
Shiki,......
Neku,"So, um, yeah... Let's scan him. OK?"
Neku,(Something about that guy... How 'bout we scan him?)
Makoto,(Waaaaaah... Has the boss lost his mind? Shelling out the money for Q

Neku,"But what's ""Q Floor""?"
Shiki,...... Neku. Up there...The big screen-- that's Q Floor.
Neku,The one playing commercials? ! This is all starting to make sense!
Shiki,So dominating the scramble crossing view means getting the crowd here 
Neku,It sure seems that way.
Shiki,...... That'll never happen. People look straight ahead when they 
Neku,Then our mission is to get them to look UP. They have to see that ad.
Shiki,What do you think the ad's for?
Neku,(Like I know. ...Maybe he can answer that.)
Makoto,It's all over. I'm doomed... Trapped in the flaming wreckage of my 
Neku,Great. The Noise have a hold on him. You know what that means.
Shiki,......
Neku,"So, how do we get people to pay attention to that ad?"

Neku,(And how do I get you to pay attention at all? Ugh... First
first,the Noise bugging that guy!
Makoto,"Chin up, Makoto! Snap out of it! True, these pins show no sign of"
Neku,That pin... It looks just like this one. This is what he's advertising?
Shiki,It's just a regular old pin. No one's gonna watch an ad for it.
Neku,"That's for sure. But the guy's a pro, right? I'm sure he's at least got "
Makoto,"...... ! OK! First, I'm going to hand free pins out and fill Shibuya"
Neku,Uhh...no? They're going to think you're nuts.
Shiki,"""Come get some hot stuff""? That sounds like a pickup line... And pins"
Neku,We'd better intervene.
Shiki,......
Neku,(That guy's a train wreck waiting to happen. ...I can't look
Makoto,Um...excuse me.
Nao,Hmm?
Makoto,"I, umm...you, uhh..."
Nao,"Sota? Like, this guy. He's, like, talking to me?"
Makoto,Wha--
Sota,'Scuse me?
Makoto,Uh-oh...
Sota,"Whadda you want, dawg? Got somethin' to say to my Nao?"
Nao,"Like, he said he thinks I'm cute... Right?"
Makoto,Wr-wrong! I don't think that at all!
Nao,What? You don't?

Sota,Gnarly?
Makoto,F-from his arthritis! The poor man beats himself up because no one
Sota,...Hells yeah.
Makoto,Whoa! Really?
Sota,What's your name?
Makoto,It's... Makoto Miki. Friends call me Mick.
Sota,Mick... You're a good man.
Nao,"Yeah! Like, that was totally moving?"
Sota,"Handing out pins for your grandpa in the scramble... That's aces, dawg."
Nao,"Like, I think I'm in love?"
Sota,We'll wear your pins. It'd be an honor.
Makoto,Th-thanks!
Sota,"Hang in there, Mick. We'll be rootin' for you."
Nao,"Hope your granddaddy, like, cheers up?"
Makoto,"Who? Oh! M-me too... Wow, I'm on fire today! OK! Time to hand these "
Neku,Looks like it worked.
Shiki,You really think a pin like this could take off?
Neku,It better. That's our mission.
Shiki,...Yeah.
Neku,"What a handful, huh?"
Shiki,He headed down Center Street...
Neku,Then we should follow. The guy's a PR time bomb.
Reaper,"...... Like a bolt from the blue, it's time for the Reaper Review. "
Reaper,Oh ho! Question 2! What's on the sign outside the Shibu Dept. Store?
Reaper,"...I see, I see! Question 3! Bigbanfrog is No. 2 on the Noise Report."
Reaper,"Hmm, veeery interesting... OK... The results are in! Reaper Review,"
Reaper,You pass! So pass on through. [wall goes down] But! Though you make
Reaper,Bzzzt! So sorry! I can't let you pass-- until you pass.
Reaper,"...... Did you do your homework, kids? Then away we go!"
Makoto,OK! This seems like a good spot.
Neku,Here we go again...
Shiki,......
Neku,I think he could use a little help.
Makoto,"Ooh! That kid's sure to take one. Hey, there, slugger."
Shooter,WHOAAA!
Makoto,Huh?
Shooter,"Lemme guess, bro. You want me to make you one of my Slammurai..."
Makoto,Uh... I didn't--
Shooter,Don't be shy! It's cool! SLAM ON!!!
Makoto,No. I'm not here to--
Shooter,What's your favorite whammy?
Makoto,Buh--
Shooter,What are you ranked?
Makoto,I...I... I don't know!
Makoto,(Who...who is this kid!?)
Makoto,"! Unreal, bro!"
Shooter,WHOAAA!!!
Makoto,Huh?
Shooter,What's that pin?
Makoto,"Oh, this?"
Shooter,Yeah! Tell me where you got it!
Makoto,Well--
Shooter,What's it's Attack?
Makoto,"Uhh... unreal, bro?"
Shooter,Seriously? How about it's Defense?
Makoto,"Unreal, bro!"
Shooter,Whoa! BRO!!! You and me gotta battle. I want that pin!
Makoto,Huh?
Shooter,Ready? Slaaam... ON!
Shooter,"Woo... hoooooo! I won, bro! Better practice up. Rely on pins "
Makoto,Huh? But... OK... It worked!
Neku,And he does this for a living? C'mon. I saw him run up past
Shiki,...It doesn't matter anymore. Nothing does.
Neku,......
Reaper,...... Want past this wall? Bring me three Rare Metal pins. Noise No.
Neku,Three Rare Metals. 
Shiki,......
Neku,"(Wait-- the Noise Report! Quick, check your phone.)"
Neku,Got the pins we need... Now to clear the wall and find our 
Reaper,Objective met. Wall clear!
Neku,That guy... He's gone. (Where'd he run off to?)
Makoto,OK! This seems like a good spot.
Neku,Here we go again...
Shiki,......
Makoto,Pardon me. Hello? Excuse me! ...... Can't he hear me? What now?
Makoto,"(Think, Mick!)"
Makoto,! Come get some hot stuff!
Techie,!
Makoto,No good? Hot stuff! Come get some!
Techie,!
Makoto,Huh? I think I got a reaction that time. One more time!
Makoto,"(Feel it, Makoto! You're so close! You saw him react! Now,"
Makoto,! Come get some hot stuff!
Techie,!
Makoto,Oh! Hot stuff!
Makoto,Ooh! Hot!
Makoto,"Yeah, hot stuff!"
Makoto,Come get some!
Techie,...I'll take one.
Makoto,Oh. Thank you! Finally! All done. Now these pins are sure to take 
Neku,So far so good. Let's follow him back to the scramble.
Shiki,......
Makoto,"Now, to witness a phenomenon in the making! I bet I'll have to BEAT"
Neku,"Oh, come on. Handing out a few pins isn't going to ignite Shibuya. We"
Shiki,...... Just... give it up.
Neku,Huh?
Shiki,Even if we do clear the mission... I'll still... I'll never be...
Neku,!? Hey! What's gotten into you?
Neku,(What's gotten into her? That Reaper yesterday must have
Neku,(I can't just leave her by herself...)
Neku,"Hey, what gives?"
Shiki,......
Neku,You've been acting really weird today.
Shiki,......
Neku,"It's almost 3. We need to get moving, or we'll fail the mission."
Shiki,...So what?
Neku,Huh?
Shiki,There's no point. You heard what that Reaper said. ...... Even if I
Neku,What kind of question is that?
Shiki,...... I thought I'd changed. But I'll never change. I'll just go on
Neku,Says who?
Shiki,...... I was never pretty... or smart... There was nothing special 
Neku,......
Shiki,But it didn't work.
Neku,I don't-- !? WHOA! Over there! Is that... you?
Shiki,Ahh!
Eri,"The other day, I found just the cutest outfit at Ten-Four!"
Mina,"Seriously? Hey, why don't we head over there? You've still go some "
Neku,Eri? What the...
Shiki,...... [leaves]
Neku,Hey! Wait!
Neku,Two Stalkers? ...... (I better go see what's wrong...)
Shiki,So now you know.
Neku,Know what?
Shiki,...... What my entry fee was.
Neku,Huh?
Shiki,My appearance. I gave up the way I really look.
Neku,Your appearance? Then--
Shiki,This is Eri's body. I don't really look like this.
Neku,Oh. Wow...
Shiki,When I got to the UG and I saw myself... I freaked.
Neku,"Yeah. I would, too."
Shiki,But it was a happy kind of freaked.
Neku,Happy? Why?
Shiki,Because this is what I always dreamed of-- a new me. I hated who I 
Neku,...... Then why would the Reapers take your appearance? Your entry fee 
Shiki,At first... I didn't get it either. I was so excited to be Eri that I
Neku,......
Shiki,"Eri has all the things I don't. Looks, brains, design sense. Lots of"
Neku,...... (All this time... she's been as confused as me.)
Shiki,"The truth is, I'm scared! I keep trying to sound brave, saying we need"
Neku,Well... I like you the way you are.
Shiki,Huh?
Makoto,Noooooo!
Neku,What the--
Makoto,No one's wearing the pins! Why not!?
Neku,Looks like we can't relax yet. Listen. We're going to finish this
Shiki,...... All right.
Neku,You'd think he'd realize giving away a few freebies isn't 
Shiki,Seriously.
Neku,But we can't give up now.
Shiki,...Uh-huh.
Neku,Let's see what he does next.
Neku,That guy by the scramble is asking for trouble... We should
Shiki,...Uh-huh.
Makoto,Why isn't anyone talking about the pins? I worked so hard...
Prince,"Hey, Mick."
Makoto,Huh? Oh! Mr. Oji. Prince...
Prince,I saw you standing here. Why so glum?
Makoto,It's work. I'm going to lose my job. I was supposed to make these 
Prince,"Aw, Mick, you can't be serious."
Makoto,What?
Prince,"All right, listen. You've done good business for me, so I'll give it "
Makoto,Hmm. True... So then how do I change the trends?
Prince,"Lots of ways. I mean, if you were a Prince like me, just walking the"
Makoto,If people saw you wearing the pin... Right...
Prince,"OK. I've gotta run. Press date. Take care, Mick. You can do it."
Makoto,"Thanks! I'll try! Hmm... Trends, eh? OK! If the Prince can do it, so"
Neku,This guy is certifiable...
Shiki,"...But think about it. Neku, if you put the pin on and we fought some"
Neku,How do you figure?
Shiki,Rhyme and I got to talking. We noticed wearing pins in combat makes
Neku,Even though the RG people can't see us?
Shiki,"Yeah. Weird, huh?"
Neku,All right... Let's give it a try.
Neku,So wearing the red pin into combat will make it popular?
Shiki,Uh-huh. But it may take a few battles.
Neku,All right. Here goes...
Neku,We have to make that red pin popular.
Shiki,Uh-huh.
Neku,Let's start in the scramble.
Person1,Hey! Isn't that pin the coolest?
Person2,Huh? Where?
Person1,There. The one that guy's got on.
Person2,Oh yeah! Very nice. Wonder where they sell 'em.
Makoto,Whoa... People keep looking at me and smiling. Am I... I couldn't 
Neku,It worked.
Shiki,So the pins we wear in combat do change what's popular in the RG.
Neku,Uh-huh. But that guy seems to have his own theory.
Makoto,"Get ready, 104! Your trend-god cometh!"
Neku,"...... He's kind of a tool, huh?"
Neku,Next stop: 104!
Makoto,OK! Time to look trendy!
Neku,"Yeah, with a little help."
Neku,"We need to reshape the trends here, too."
Shiki,"Let's do some fighting, then."
1,"Hey, check out that hot pin!"
2,Yeah. The one on that guy? People were wearing it back at 
1,"Seriously? It's gonna be huge, just wait and see."
2,Wish I had one...
Makoto,Whoa... I get it. I really get it! The trends are mine to command! 
Neku,"Well, we did it."
Shiki,Did we?
Neku,"Hey, we gave it our best shot. Let's just cross our fingers."
Shiki,"...... Neku... Umm... I'm sorry. If we fail, and it turns out to be my"
Neku,"...... No big deal. We all, umm..."
Shiki,Hmm?
Neku,We all have our bad days.
Shiki,Neku... Thanks.
Neku,"! Hey, it's her."
Shiki,!? Ahh!
Mina,"So, Eri. How come you haven't designed anything lately?"
Eri,...... Actually... I'm thinking about giving it up.
Mina,What! Why? You're so talented!
Shiki,"She's giving it up? Eri, why... ......"
Neku,"If you want to know, scan her."
Shiki,What? I can't do that! She's my friend. I can't eavesdrop on her
Neku,Why not? You've scanned tons of people.
Shiki,......
Mina,"Eri, why would you give design up?"
Shiki,......
Eri,"Well, there was this girl, Shiki--"
Shiki,!? Neku... I have to go!
Neku,Hey! Just...wait!
Shiki,I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't want to hear Eri talk about me. I was 
Neku,......
Shiki,"Eri told me something before I died. ""You're not meant to be a"
Neku,"Oh, would you cut the crap? Who ARE you?"
Shiki,Huh?
Neku,You're you. You're not Eri. You'll never be Eri. You'll only ever be 
Shiki,But she's so much better--
Neku,"Forget her! You need to live your own life. If she can do it, so can "
Shiki,...... Neku--
Neku,You're lucky you're jealous. It gives you something to shoot for. So...
Shiki,"...... You're right. Thanks, Neku."
Neku,It's time. The commercial's about to air.
Makoto,Sooo nervous... Will people watch?
Shiki,Neku...
Neku,Don't worry. They'll watch.
1,Hey! Up there!
2,That pin. Who designed it? It looks like--
3,"Hey, cool graphic."
4,I never wear pins. But this one...
5,Where can I buy it?
Shooter,"Hey, man, look what I got."
Yammer,"You HAVE one? Aw, lucky..."
Eri,"Oh, I know that pin!"
Mina,"Ha ha. You would, Eri. Wish I had one..."
Shiki,"Eri... ...... Neku, can I have a minute? I want to go stand by her."
Neku,"Hey, you're off the clock."
Shiki,...Thanks!
Mina,"Eri, you shouldn't give up design."
Eri,"I told you. This girl, Shiki-- I'm nothing without her."
Shiki,Huh?
Mina,"Yeah, you said that. What, did you two have a fight?"
Eri,A fight? I wish. Shiki died. In an accident the other day.
Mina,Oh... I'm so sorry.
Eri,No one else could ever make my outfits. Shiki gave them life. Made them
Mina,You must have trusted her a lot.
Eri,I did! She was an amazing person. She cared about people-- and always
Mina,"The way you talk about her, she must have been something."
Eri,...... The day before her accident... I said something I'll always 
Mina,What?
Eri,She was upset 'cause she couldn't come up with a good design. I wanted 
Shiki,...... I had no idea. I never knew she felt that way about me.
Neku,Guess you two both need each other.
Shiki,Neku... You think I'm OK the way I am?
Neku,"Hey, Shibuya's got room for all types. Who else is gonna make stuffed"
Shiki,He's a cat! Heh heh... Neku... I want to see Eri again. So we can be a
Neku,All right. Then whatever it takes... Let's win... Let's live. Just one
Megumi,We're on schedule.
Higashizawa,"Yes, sir! Three Players remain. Tomorrow I shall ice them"
Megumi,"I look forward to it. See this week's Game through to its conclusion,"
Higashizawa,"As your proxy, sir, I promise you I will not fail."
Megumi,"You know, enough with this ""proxy"" business. Too formal. I hereby "

Neku,"""The Game Master awaits you on the freeway. Defeat him. You have 600"
Shiki,"Oww! The Game Master is that big Reaper, right?"
Neku,We need to pay him back for Rhyme.
Shiki,Yeah... C'mon. We've got a Game to win. For Beat... and for us!
Neku,! Who could be calling us now?
Shiki,Think it's the Reapers?
Neku,Hello? Dead kid speaking.
H,Phones! That you?
Neku,Mr. Hanekoma?
H,"Listen! Beat, he... he's gone!"
Neku,Gone!? You don't mean...
H,"No, no...Not erased. ...Not yet."

Shiki,Move! We're in a hurry!
Reaper,Six days you're still kickin'. I'm impressed.
Shiki,I said MOVE!
Reaper,"Aww, sorry. No dice. It's a race to erase, and I aim to"

Uzuki,Yashiro here. ...... What!? You want us to WHAT!? 
Uzuki,Graaah!
Kariya,"Easy, girl! What's the deal?"
Uzuki,Standby! We're just supposed to sit here! This is an insult!
Kariya,Take it down a notch before you pop a blood vessel. I don't see a
Uzuki,Ugh! This is why I hate the way he runs things!
Kariya,Really? I kinda like it.
Uzuki,"What's to like!? It's one big, cryptic mess! It pisses me off!"
Kariya,He can't help it. I'm sure he's worked out some crazy plan-- 
Neku,(Come on... There has to be someone! I need this... I have to win! 
Neku,A pact? With who!?
Joshua,Howdy.
Neku,(Who the--)
Joshua,The name's Yoshiya Kiryu. But Mother and Father call me Joshua.
Neku,(Please don't tell me...)
Joshua,"I guess you can call me Joshua, too-- seeing as how you're my dear,"
Neku,Your what!? (This pipsqueak is my new partner!?)
Joshua,"You seem like such a pro at this, I just... helped myself."
Neku,A pro? How could you know that?
Joshua,"I've been watching you, silly. Very impressive by the way."
Neku,"(Huh? Was he a Player last time, too? But wait... No, there was nobody"
Joshua,"Today's the first day and all... Let's just take it easy, hmm? Why"
Neku,F-fine. (Something about him just...grates.)
Joshua,What's wrong? Don't tell me you've forgotten how to scan?
Neku,"Look, I... I know, OK? (Ugh! Smug little...)"
Joshua,Going somewhere? Step one is to collect some info. Give the
Neku,"Uhhh, no? I know what I'm doing, all right?"
Joshua,Hee hee... Then what's the holdup?
Neku,"(Obnoxious little... Scan your damn self, if you're in such a"
Neku,(Nngh! ...What? What did I just see? That place looked like... the
Joshua,Something wrong? Are we not feeling well?
Neku,"(Wait, did I... did I just scan him? )"
Joshua,Is this going to be a problem? I need you to pull it together. Unlike
Neku,...I'll be fine.
Joshua,Will you? Wonderful. Then can we go?
Neku,(Something's weird here... How was I able to scan him? He's a Player.)
Joshua,"Hmm? What's the holdup, Neku?"
Neku,It's nothing.
Joshua,Don't tell me you're still stuck on the mission mail. Please. It's
Neku,......
Joshua,"X marks the spot. 30+74, Neku. We're headed to 104. If you ever find"
Neku,(I'm going to choke this kid.)
Joshua,"Oh! I can't say I'm particularly interested, but... I'll go ahead and"
Neku,...... Neku.
Joshua,"Neku, hmm? Hee hee... Charming."
Neku,(Gaaah!)
Joshua,"Well then, Neku. Shall we?"
Joshua,"Is there a problem, Neku? Forget where we're going already?"
Neku,"I remember! 104, geez."
Joshua,"Hee hee. Then let's go, hmm?"
Reaper,Want to clear this wall? Then take down these Noise!
Neku,Another wall...
Joshua,So we need to clear out a few Noise to get by. All right. What better
Neku,(He has to be doing this on purpose...)
Joshua,"Put simply, I play things high or low."
Neku,High or low?
Joshua,You should be able to pick it up on the fly. Ready for a little
Joshua,All right. That's fine. We'll wait until you're ready to 
Joshua,"Then let's begin, hmm?"
Joshua,Well? Get the basic gist of it? Care to give it another go?
Joshua,Hee hee... If you insist.
Joshua,"We're in this together from now on. You watch my behind, I'll watch"
Neku,......
Reaper,Objective met. Wall clear!
Neku,Timer's gone... We're safe. That's one day down...
Joshua,! Neku... What do you suppose that is?
Neku,What the hell? That junk heap wasn't here before!
Minamimoto,You're zetta slow!
Neku,What!? Who said that?
Joshua,Don't look at me. Look at your junk heap there.
Neku,There's somebody up there?
Minamimoto,"I said, you're zetta slow! How long does it take to crack a Z-"
Neku,Hecto-what?
Neku,Nngh! My...head!
Minamimoto,Sho Minamimoto. Remember the name. I'm the new Game Master.
Neku,Then you're a Reaper.
Minamimoto,! Wait. You... You're a Player this time around?
Neku,"Nngh, who... me?"
Minamimoto,Hmph. Now that's a happy miscalculation. This brings me one
Neku,Solution? ...Nngh! What are you talking about?
Joshua,"Hee hee... Day 1, and the GM's already putting in an appearance? Not"
Minamimoto,Tradition? Tradition is garbage! CRUNCH! I'll add it to the heap!
Joshua,I'd hear you were quite the eccentric...
Minamimoto,"Some Old Horses Can Always Hear Their Owner Approach. Now, time "
Joshua,Pray tell.
Minamimoto,One yoctogram!
Neku,Yoctogram?
Joshua,Nice. That puts us on the atomic level?
Minamimoto,Precisely! You 000s have no value here. So! Now that I have you
Joshua,"Whew... Well, so much for Day 1."
Neku,(That Reaper knew me... How?)
Joshua,"Rather fascinating, wasn't he?"
Neku,Uhh...
Joshua,"At least we won't be too bored this week, hmm?"
Neku,"(This kid, too... There's something seriously not right about him.)"
Joshua,I wonder what the little math fetishist will think up for tomorrow.
Neku,"(Hmph. He's shady... Still, ""trust your partner,"" right? I need him if"
Joshua,"Well, the two of us should be able to cruise right through this week-"
Neku,"(Ugh, I'll never get used to this! But I'll deal with the devil if "
Day,Rulez. Chapter Closed]
Reaper,Nope. No luck. This one's not opening either.
Kariya,"Well, thanks anyway. You're dismissed. He's sealed off Route 1... "
Uzuki,"Hey, Kariya!"
Kariya,Any luck?
Uzuki,"Routes 2, 5, and 6 are all sealed."
Kariya,"Gotta hand it to him, the guy works fast."
Uzuki,He could have told us what areas are open. What the hell is he 
Kariya,"Naw, it's nice to see the boss do the legwork. I say we kick back and"
Uzuki,Well I say this is a work week. It would be nice to actually work! The
Kariya,I sure hope it's your mouth.
Uzuki,Hmm... Maybe I should just hop over to the RG. Use this baby to 
Kariya,"Whoa there, cowgirl. Reapers whackin' folks in the RG is a no-no."
Uzuki,Don't be stupid. I'm joking! ...Mostly. I'm just saying we may be 
Kariya,"You keep talking about work, work, work. It's-- ...... Impossible!"
Uzuki,"Exactly! We can't go on like this. I'm THIS close to a promotion, but"
Kariya,Uzuki! Look out!!!
Neku,Nngh... Where...? (Back at the scramble crossing... Where's that other
Joshua,Are we still on track with the goods? What? You already got them in!?
Neku,"(Oh, he's on the phone. ! Wait a minute... How did he place a call!? "
Joshua,The scramble... Which areas? ...Sealed? In that case... ...and the 
Neku,"(Wait, is he reporting in to the Reapers? Definitely shady... I can't"
Neku,(You're not supposed to be able to scan other Players. But

Neku,"(As much as I'd love to ditch his ass, I can't clear the"
Joshua,"Right... Exactly, so..."
Neku,"(I need to trust him, but... Ugh, how? Something's not right"
Neku,Huff...huff... That was... me? Why was I passed out in Udagawa? 
Neku,! The mission!
Joshua,"Hmm? Was that the mission, Neku?"
Neku,"What? Oh... Yeah. (For now, I can only watch and wait.) The mission "
Joshua,"Say, Neku. I have a little proposal."
Neku,...What?
Joshua,Let's play hooky today. Forget about the mission.
Neku,"What!? Are you crazy? If we don't do this, we get erased!"
Joshua,But there's someplace I reeeally want to go. Let the other Players 
Neku,"Yes, we do! I can't afford to screw around on this! I'm not letting"
Joshua,"Oh, don't get so wound up, Neku. It's only Day 2! Enjoy it while it's"
Neku,"I'm not just playing this for me anymore! Her life is on the line, too."
Neku,...Where are we?
Shiki,It's too bright... I can't see a thing.
Beat,Yo...
Shiki,Beat! You're safe!
Beat,"Yeah. You too, huh?"
Neku,......
Shiki,Why'd you run off on your own like that? You had us all so worried!
Beat,"I...I jus' had to... Look, yo... my bad. I jus' had to take off."
Neku,......
Shiki,So... Are we...alive again?
Megumi,"I'm afraid not. Not yet, anyway."
Beat,Who's there!?
Megumi,"Hello, and congratulations. You all are victors. How did you find our"
Beat,You're...
Megumi,"Megumi Kitaniji. Conductor of the Game, and loyal servant to the"
Neku,(Conductor of... Then he's the head Reaper?)
Megumi,"Now then, regarding your fates... As per the Composer's mandate, the"
Shiki,Huh!?
Neku,What did you say?
Shiki,But that's... that's cruel! I thought everyone got to come back!
Megumi,Any and all specifics are decided by the Composer. That is His
Shiki,Why do you think we came this far!? To live again! Every last one of 
Beat,Hold up! Not exactly...
Shiki,Not exactly what?
Beat,Not everybody... I... ...... I ain't goin' back.
Shiki,What!?
Beat,"I... I wanna be a Reaper! So how 'bout it, yo? Make me part a' your "
Shiki,Wha... Beat!?
Megumi,...... Very well. Your wish is within my authority to grant. The
Beat,......
Neku,Beat! Why!?
Beat,......
Shiki,"Hey, wait! BEAT!"
Shiki,Why would Beat want to join the Reapers?
Neku,......
Megumi,"The hour of reckoning draws near. Your points have been tallied, and"
Shiki,!? M-me!? But... I can't... I'm not going back alone-- I can't! It's
Megumi,We grade Players according to their performance during the missions.
Shiki,But that can't be right! Neku is way better with psychs than me! And 
Neku,...... If only one of us gets a second chance... what happens to the 
Megumi,"If you still cling to life, you may reenter the Game. If you lean"
Neku,...... Shiki... You go on ahead.
Shiki,No way!
Neku,Just go! Trust me.
Shiki,"I'm not leaving without you, Neku! I'll enter the Game again. Let "
Megumi,Out of the question. As I mentioned a moment ago. This was decided by
Shiki,No way...
Neku,Shiki... Don't worry about me.
Shiki,But Neku--
Neku,Didn't you swear you'd go back and see Eri again?
Shiki,......
Neku,I still don't even know how I died. I don't know if I have anything to 
Shiki,Neku...
Neku,"You're not gonna start slipping back now, are you?"
Shiki,Huh?
Neku,Back to the old Shiki.
Shiki,"N-no... ...... I'm so sorry, Neku. Thank you. I'll go back-- back to "
Neku,There you go.
Shiki,"I'll be waiting for you-- every day, in front of Hachiko...till you "
Neku,I'll see you there soon. That's a promise.
Megumi,"Finished your goodbyes, then?"
Shiki,!? Neku!
Shiki,"Once you see the real me, will we still be friends?"
Neku,Count on it. You'll always be Shiki.
Neku,Shiki...
Megumi,And now it's your turn. You seem to have your mind made up.
Neku,Damn straight. I'll play your Game again.
Megumi,Excellent. No doubt you'll make it an exciting one. Then before the
Neku,Nnnnnngh!!! Huff...huff... What... What the hell did you just do to 
Megumi,I simply returned to you what is yours. Fair is fair.
Neku,"Nngh, I get it now... This explains a lot. My memory... was gone..."
Megumi,Indeed. Memories are the single greatest determinant of a person's
Neku,!? Hey... Wait just a... Where's the rest!?
Megumi,Beg pardon?
Neku,It's missing! How did I die!? I still can't remember anything about my
Megumi,Oh really? Most fascinating...
Neku,Cut the crap! You're the one who...
Megumi,HOWEVER. That has nothing to do with the Game.
Neku,What!?
Megumi,I returned your memory in its entirety. If you still can't recall
Neku,I never...?
Megumi,What could I possibly stand to gain from depriving you of that 
Neku,(...He's right. So why is that the only hole in my memory?)
Megumi,Now then. As for your new entry fee--
Neku,You're taking my memory again!?
Megumi,A Player's entry fee is that which they hold most dear. That is the
Neku,What!?
Megumi,"This time, you're playing for... Shiki Misaki."
Neku,WHAT!? That's not... NOOOOO!
Neku,I...
Joshua,......
Neku,I got her dragged back into this. But I'll be damned if I let it end 
Joshua,...... Hmph.
Neku,"! ""Hmph,"" what!? Weren't you listening?"
Joshua,Uh-huh. And here's me playing the world's tiniest violin.
Neku,You little... I just--
Joshua,Did you think you were special? Every Player here put up something 
Neku,Sacrifices? Are you... (No. Gotta calm down. Losing it here will only
Joshua,"...... Oh, I suppose. You'll just owe me one."
Neku,(Owe you one what!? You're a Player! Clearing the mission HELPS you!
Joshua,"You have yourself a deal, Neku. So? What's the mission?"
Neku,"""Game II: Acquire the v3 Au pin. ""t = 300 min. Incompletes will be"
Neku,Nngh... Clock's ticking. So what's up with this mission? It's 
Joshua,"We know it has something to do with a pin. Any thoughts beyond that,"
Neku,"Au...The periodic symbol for gold? A pin made of gold, maybe?"
Joshua,Hmm... Not a bad hypothesis. Let's go with that for now. What about 
Neku,"v3... Well, the square root of 3 is 1.7320508. Some kind of entry code?"
Joshua,"Ooh, a tantalizing possibility, Neku! I'm so proud."
Neku,(...Bite me.)
Joshua,But I think it's referring to a street here in Shibuya.
Neku,A street?
Joshua,The Reapers use numbers to refer to each of Shibuya's streets. Route 
Neku,(How does HE know that? And why go asking me-- to make me look stupid?)
Joshua,So let's check out Route 3.
Neku,Which is?
Joshua,The road leading from Cadoi City to Molco. Shall we?
Neku,(He knows too much. About the Reapers' Game and about my death... He's
Neku,(...... He knows something.)
Joshua,...Hmm? Keep staring and you'll make me blush. Route 3 runs
Neku,I heard you. Let's go.
Joshua,"Yes, sir!"
Yammer,I'm out of time. Even if I practice from now till the
man,What did Makoto want? He said it was important. 
Reaper,...... Want past this wall? Erase all the Noise possessing people in
Neku,Eliminate the Noise possessing people here...
Joshua,"Well, they usually target folks who are negative. ......"
Neku,Wh-what!?
Joshua,"Oh, nothing. ...I just hate negative people, don't you?"
Neku,"(Yeah, and you're just a bundle of joy. Look, let's just kill"
Yammer,I thought I had Shooter this time... But he keeps getting
man,Dammit. He must have caught me filching his fried
man,Gaaah! I can't let little things like this slow me
Yammer,"Right... I can do this. If I'm gonna play, I'm going for gold! "
Neku,Some kind of contest at Molco for Tin Pin Slammer? The grand prize is
Joshua,"""Going for gold""?"
Neku,Of course! This is it!
Joshua,Certainly seems that way. It's a safe guess that our mission is to 
Neku,"All right, then we'd better get over to Molco."
Joshua,"Well, no more negative people around here... Nope, not a "
Neku,"OK, OK. Let's go."
Joshua,Hee hee.
Reaper,...... Objective met. Wall clear!
Uzuki,Huff...huff...
Kariya,Still alive over there?
Uzuki,Barely... What the heck was that thing?
Kariya,A Noise that targets Reapers.
Uzuki,"Well, duh! But that's... It's impossible!"
Kariya,"Somebody must have cooked some up. A fresh, steamy batch of Taboo"
Uzuki,What!? But that's a capital offense!
Kariya,Do I smell another game? First one to find out who's behind this--
Uzuki,Kariya! This is no time for your stupid games! I'm calling 
Joshua,"Why the hurry, Neku? Molco's just a few blocks away. We've"
Neku,You never know what'll happen. Let's get this done.
Joshua,"OK, OK..."
Neku,"C'mon, already! Get a move on!"
Joshua,"Sigh... I don't do the whole sweating thing, Neku."
Joshua,!?
Neku,Wha-- Are those Noise!?
Joshua,Black Noise? They look different than the usual riffraff.
Neku,So what's the plan?
Joshua,I doubt we'd make it if we tried to run.
Neku,Then we take 'em out!
Neku,What the hell were those? I've never seen black Noise.
Joshua,Likewise.
Neku,"Bastards were tough, huh?"
Joshua,Not only that... I couldn't really hurt them unless I had the light
Neku,Huh? ...Really? (Wow... Maybe this kid does have his uses--)
Joshua,"Hmm? Don't tell me you didn't notice, Neku. That doesn't inspire much"
Neku,(--even if he is a snot.)
Joshua,"In any case, why did it pick a fight?"
Neku,Yeah... Our pact should prevent that.
Joshua,How bizarre...
Neku,We don't have time to screw around. Let's get to Molco and
Joshua,"Yes, sir!"
Neku,This is it. They're holding the slam-off inside the store.
Person,"Dude, it's a Tin Pin slam-off! Those always rock."
Joshua,Looks like a popular event.
Neku,(...And I've got to win it.) Let's go.
Neku,So this is Tin Pin Slammer... All I need to do is figure out some way 
Joshua,Good luck with that. At least there's a Reaper decal here. You won't
Neku,"The decal makes us visible, right?"
Joshua,Yup. Every shop licensed to sell to Players has one.
Neku,"I'm not complaining, but... why let us shop at all? The Reapers want us"
Joshua,Hmm... Does it really matter? Shopping is fun. The Game's better this
Neku,"(Yeah, 'cause the Game's all about fun...)"
Joshua,"If you don't hurry, you'll miss registration, Neku."
Neku,"OK, OK, I'm going. (Going...to do what? I've never played Tin Pin "
Neku,(So... How do you even play this game?) Do you know how to play Tin Pin
Joshua,Who? Me? Don't be silly. I don't have a clue. Good thing I'm not
Neku,What!?
Joshua,"I thought you were going to clear this mission, Neku?"
Neku,...... (I shouldn't have bothered asking. So who DO I ask?) Gah! What
Shooter,"SORRY! I wasn't watching where I was going! Hmm? Hey, you've got "
Neku,"Um, yes?"
Shooter,So you're entering the slam-off?
Joshua,That's right! Losing's not an option. ...For Neku.
Neku,(But you're cool with the idea!?)
Shooter,"So, if you're not losing, then-- Wait, you're going for FIRST?"
Neku,Wh-what's wrong with my pins?
Shooter,"Is this, like, your first time EVER or something? Forget about the"
Neku,(The kid's sure blunt enough.)
Joshua,"I take it you're playing today, uh..."
Shooter,Shuto Dan. Call me Shooter! And yeah! I'm actually kinda famous 
Joshua,"Wow, Shooter. You must be a real expert. Are there any tips you could"
Neku,"(Thanks a lot, partner!)"
Joshua,"Come on, Neku, what do we say?"
Neku,Rrgh. ...Please?
Shooter,"Well, you do look pretty hopeless... OK, bro! Tin Pin's a battle"
Neku,Between...souls.
Shooter,"Yeah, bro! It's like your fiery passion slams into the other guy's,"
Joshua,Hee hee. Sounds like a fun time.
Neku,...... Think you could be a little more specific?
Shooter,Just a sec! I'll draw it out clear and easy for you!
Shooter,Here! THIS is Tin Pin Slammer!
Neku,...... (It hurts to look...)
Joshua,"My, my. Then there's quite a bit of depth to it."
Shooter,Right!? The timing right here is super important!
Joshua,"This is practically a map to victory, huh, Neku?"
Neku,......
Joshua,Neku? Do you still not get it?
Shooter,"What!? You need MORE explanation!? Aww, man! OK, fine... Let's SLAM!"
Neku,"What, right now!?"
Shooter,"Heh heh! You've got pretty good form, bro."
Shooter,Whoa! Y-you're a fast learner.
Neku,(So I just need to knock the other guy's pins off...)
Shooter,All clear now? Wanna slam again?
Shooter,OK! On your mark... Get set... SLAM!!!
Shooter,NICE!!! You picked it up pretty good!
Neku,"(I kinda, sorta get it...)"
Shooter,"Every pin's got its own stats, so try a buncha stuff out! Keep in"
Neku,(The ones I'm wearing?) So I can't play if I'm not wearing any pins?
Shooter,"NAW, BRO! That's totally cool, too! You can borrow special slamming"
Neku,"Thanks, but... no."
Shooter,WHOA! Look at the time! See ya! Good luck!
Announcer,"Things are rrreally heating up, folks! It's time for ourrr next"
Neku,(Bring it!)
Announcer,"In the red corner, the comeback kid comes back! Slams down curry"
Yammer,Heh heh... I hand-design and build all my pin mods. It's Yammer Time!
Announcer,"Players, on your marks... Get set...SLAM!!!"
Neku,Yes!
Shooter,"WOW!!! Your first time playing, and you (dun dun DAAAH!) totally "
Joshua,"Very impressive, Neku. Show those fifth graders who's boss."
Neku,"(Thanks for killing my high, man.)"
Shooter,"Too bad next round, though."
Neku,Huh?
Shooter,"You're facing the TOP SEED, man. You're history."
Neku,Top seed?
Shooter,That means crazy insane strong. Dumb luck won't get you through the
Neku,"(Dumb luck? I mean, sure, I'm not exactly a pro, but... Hmm, I should"
Joshua,"Hee hee. Well, I'll be waiting in the stands, Neku. Do your best,"
Neku,(Damn right I will. This is important.)
Announcer,"The air is electric here in the slam mall! Next up, the main "
Neku,(Who wants some?)
Announcer,"In the red corner, the top seed and Slammurai legend..."
Neku,(I don't care who he is. I have to win.)
Announcer,Shuto Daaaan!
Neku,Him!?
Shooter,"HEY, MAN! I'm impressed you got this far! Sorry, but I can't let you"
Neku,"I'm up against this kid? Ugh... (Well, if this is what it takes...)"
Shooter,Taste the rage of my Red Kaiser! Innn... PINCIBLE!
Neku,Gah! It...it's over. I lost?
Shooter,"You seemed pretty tough, bro! I had to get serious!"
Announcer,"And just like that, the match is over! Shooter does it again! The"
Shooter,"Watch out, Shibuya! When I'm on, I am ON!!! Woo! Time for the final"
Neku,"There is no next time! Shiki... I'm sorry, I--"
Joshua,"Aww, what a shame. Not that I'm shocked. You're a Tin Pin virgin. "
Neku,Don't you see what this means!? We failed! We screwed up the mission!
Joshua,You sure did. But relax...
Neku,Relax!? How can--
Announcer,Uh-oh! Looks like trouble for our champ!
Neku,What happened?
Joshua,What indeed? Sounds like an upset.
Neku,Let's check it out.
Shooter,"My pin... It won't eject! No, Red Kaiser! NOOO!"
Announcer,It looks like a freak malfunction has cost the top seed the
Joshua,"Oh, my! Looks like Shooter lost."
Neku,! Huh? The timer's gone. Wait... We cleared the mission?
Joshua,"The guy who just won is a Player, too."
Neku,What?
Nao,"So, like, where'd the timer go?"
Sota,"Mission accomplished! We did it, Nao!"
Joshua,"I thought you knew, Neku? It doesn't matter which Player clears the"
Neku,Whew... We're safe.
Nao,"So that's, like, another day down?"
Sota,"Hope tomorrow's this easy, too!"
Shooter,"Wait up, man! I want a... rematch... Huh? Where'd he go? You can't"
Joshua,Let the other Players take care of the missions. We just need to do
Neku,And what if nobody clears the mission? If that kid's toy hadn't broken
Joshua,"Hee hee... Oh, I'm willing to make some minimal effort. You don't"
Neku,What!?
Joshua,I borrowed your opponents' pins and swapped in a few of my own. Of
Neku,Unbelievable...
Joshua,You didn't need to win. Shooter just had to lose.
Neku,You're... You're devious!
Joshua,"Oh, come on. You wanted to win. Wasn't that the whole reason for"
Neku,"OK, fine. Then why didn't you tell me?"
Joshua,Hee hee... Don't you think it's more fun with a little suspense?
Neku,No.
Joshua,"Besides, you might've won anyway. I didn't want to hurt your "
Neku,You smug little... Is this fun for you? I'm not your toy!
Joshua,"If you're done, it's my turn now."
Neku,For what!?
Joshua,"I've got an errand to run, and you're coming along."
Neku,I just said I'm not your--
Joshua,"You agreed to this, Neku. After the mission, we do what I want."
Neku,Rrgh! ...Fine.
Joshua,Good. Then let's head back to the scramble.
Minamimoto,"What, you're just going to ignore me? You half-blind "
Neku,!? Hecto...Ugh.
Neku,Nngh! Not again... My head's... pounding...
Joshua,"Oh, look. It's a stray Reaper. You seem even grouchier than usual."
Minamimoto,Damn right! That game was zetta dull! Are you trying to bore me 
Joshua,"Wow, you sat there watching the entire mission? Do GMs always have "
Minamimoto,No comments from the peanut gallery. Your opinions are garbage!
Joshua,"Hee hee... I figured you weren't much for criticism. Otherwise, why"
Minamimoto,Heh. Even inch of my work is flawlessly calculated. Look at the
Joshua,"Gee, I wonder."
Minamimoto,"ZERO, same as your taste! Attention, all tasteless tetrahedra! If"
Neku,(Finally... The pounding's stopped. What language is that guy 
Joshua,"Think he's got a thing for you, Neku?"
Neku,What!? How the hell do you figure that?
Joshua,"Oh, please! The way he follows you around?"
Neku,That's just because I'm a Player.
Joshua,I don't see him chasing after the other Players.
Neku,(He's right... So why me?)
Joshua,...Or is it my fault?
Neku,"(What? That's right... He might be tied in with the Reapers. If he is,"
Megumi,...Destroy the ones you called friends. Those are your orders.
Beat,I gotta follow orders?
Megumi,Of course. We require proof of your loyalty to the Reapers.
Beat,"Aight, yo, don't get your panties in a twist. I'm a Reaper. I'll do it."
Megumi,I trust that you will.
Beat,I swear... ...... I'ma do this! I didn't join up for nothin'.
Day,Reapers. Chapter Closed]
Neku,Where...? (The scramble again? And Joshua? ...He's on the phone again.)
Joshua,"Yup... I'll be there today. You'll have it all ready for me, won't "
Neku,"(Who's he talking to? Same person as yesterday?) ...... (Well, "
Joshua,"Say, Neku."
Neku,(...That smile makes me nervous. What are you scheming now?) Yeees?
Joshua,"You're coming with me today, right? There's someplace I'd like to go."
Neku,......
Joshua,"You never followed through on your promise yesterday. So today, "
Neku,"No way! I told you yesterday-- first, we do the mission. Then you can"
Joshua,"! Whoa, you're right. There it is, Neku! Let's see... ""Proceed to Cat"
limit,"15 minutes."""
Neku,Fifteen minutes!? That's on the other side of Shibuya!
Joshua,"We'd better hurry, then."
Neku,No joke! Shut up and start running! Come on!
Joshua,"Yes, sir!"
Neku,We've only got fifteen minutes! We better haul ass!
Joshua,"Definitely. For Cat Street, we'd want Route 2. From here to"
Joshua,"Say, Neku. Hate to bother you when you're in a hurry, but--"
Neku,What do you want!? Just run!
Joshua,"If we're going to Cat Street, it's a lot faster to go past"
Neku,Wha-- Why didn't you say so before!?
Joshua,You seemed to know where you were going. I figured you had
Neku,"(Like beating you senseless?) Ugh, fine. Let's just hurry!"
Reaper,...
Neku,Ugh! Not one of THEM?
Joshua,Looks like there's a wall up ahead.
Neku,"Dammit, we don't have time for this! (...There's only one way to Cat"
Neku,Rrgh! His timing sucks!
Joshua,"Hmm, sure does. Wonder what today's challenge will be."
Reaper,...... Want past this wall? Then beat three of these-- where I can 
Neku,We can't waste time here!
Joshua,"Three of the Noise symbols he showed us, right?"
Neku,Right. Let's do it!
Joshua,Whew...
Neku,Done! That should take care of the wall.
Reaper,...... Objective met. Wall clear!
Neku,All right! Let's sprint from here!
Joshua,"Oh, dear... Feeling energetic today, isn't he?"
Neku,"You run, too!"
Joshua,"Coming, sir!"
Reaper,...... Want past this wall? Then bring me one Pop Pendulum. It's a 
Neku,"Rrgh, we need a specific pin!?"
Joshua,This could be a good time to crank down our level. Taking 
Joshua,"Nice work, Neku. You got today's magic pin."
Neku,Right... Let's just get the wall cleared.
Reaper,Objective met. Wall clear!
Neku,Huff...huff... Made it! Did we clear the mission!? !? Huh? No timer...
Joshua,"Whew! We finally made it. It's that café just over there, Neku."
Neku,Wait... Don't tell me... You lied to me!?
Joshua,"Kinda, yeah. I'm surprised it worked this well."
Neku,You...UGH! I can't believe you!
Joshua,"Oh, come on. No harm done. It's not like we have a real mission yet."
Neku,......
Neku,Augh! You must love jerking people around.
Joshua,"There there, Neku. Just be grateful this wasn't a real"
Neku,"Hey, I... Why are you doing this!?"
Joshua,I felt like coffee. Cat Street has a lovely café. Care to
Joshua,Mr. H? You in?
H,"Heyyy! I was waiting for ya, Josh."
Neku,Mr. Hanekoma!?
H,"Hmm? Oh, Phones! What, you're in the Game again?"
Neku,"Yeah... And because of that, Shiki's... She was my entry fee."
H,"They took the young lady, huh... Well, buck up. Nothin' you can do "
Neku,...Thanks.
Joshua,I see you two are acquainted.
Neku,Yeah. He saved our asses more than once last week.
Joshua,What a coincidence. He's been in the business of saving my ass for 
Neku,(The two seem to go way back. Is this where Joshua learned all about 
Joshua,"I hate to seem impatient, but could we, you know?"
H,"Sure thing, J. Lemme see your phones."
Joshua,"Yours too, Neku."
Neku,My phone? What do you need with it?
Joshua,Just doing a little upgrade.
H,"More features the better, right? Gimme just a sec, guys."
Joshua,"I told him we were coming, so it shouldn't take long."
Neku,"Told him how? Wait, so you the person you were talking to on the phone"
Joshua,"Mr. H, of course."
Neku,"(Man, now I feel like an idiot. Mr. Hanekoma's got his secrets, but "
H,"Sorry for the wait, guys. Here ya go."
Joshua,Thanks. Now we can finally go on a little hunt.
Neku,A hunt? For what?
Joshua,You'll see when we find it. Let's step out front and give the tracker 
Joshua,"Hmm, no response around here."
Neku,......(Just what is this tracker tracking? )
Joshua,"Ready to go, Neku? We'll canvass Shibuya and look for signals."
Neku,(Should I really go along with this?)
H,"What's up, Phones? You look like ya got something on your mind."
Neku,So this is your place?
H,"Yup! I call it ""WildKat."" Pretty hip, right?"
Neku,"Yeah... (It's a nice enough looking place, but... nobody's here. How's "
H,"Always did love me some beans. I got to be such an addict, I started "
Neku,Because you love... beans. (Who gets into coffee because they like 
H,"Oh, hey! I said I'd fix you up with a cuppa last time, huh? Have one "
Neku,(You're CHARGING?)
Neku,So how do you two know each other?
H,"What, me and Josh? I've known him for a while now. He'd swing by when "
Neku,"""Special""?"
H,Yeah. He sees things.
Neku,"Things? Like what? ""I see dead people,"" kind of sees things?"
H,Pretty much. That's how he knew about the Game. He saw Players and
Neku,Oh...
H,"And when he wanted to talk about it, he came to me. There aren't many"
Neku,......
Neku,"The Reapers are supposed to give out one mission per day, right? We "
H,That's what I hear. The Game Master's the one who handles all the
Neku,"(The Game Master... This time, it's that whack-job junk collector. He's"
H,The missions are guaranteed to show up on your phone. When one's 
Neku,So what's this phone upgrade you gave us?
H,"Oh, the tracker?"
Neku,"Whatever you call it. So...what, it picks up some kind of signal?"
H,Pretty much. I set both your phones to locate energy spikes now. The
Neku,What exactly is an energy spike?
H,You can ask Josh what you guys are looking for.
Neku,...... (Not if I want a straight answer.)
H,"There's one other feature in there now, too."
Neku,Another one? What's it do?
H,I told Josh how to use it. Ask him.
Neku,...... (Not if I want a straight answer.)
H,"If you're bored, go take a walk with Joshua. You still don't have a"
Neku,"Yeah, but..."
H,You don't look convinced. Did you forget already? If you wanna survive
Neku,"Trust my partner, I know. It's just..."
H,"You still got a long way to go, Phones. Knowing it in your head "
Neku,......
H,Enjoy every moment with all ya got.
Neku,! What!? What did you just say?
H,Huh? I say something weird?
Neku,"""Enjoy every moment with all you've got."" That's the motto of the one"
H,You coulda fooled me.
Neku,"Well, now's not really the time to be enjoying life."
H,"Uh-huh... You really have got a long way to go. Listen up, Phones! The"
Neku,Are you kidding? I'm stuck in the Reapers' Game. I can't even leave
H,That's for you to figure out.
Neku,(Expand my world...)
H,Now go on! Git!
Neku,...So. What are we looking for with that thing?
Joshua,"Hee hee... What, indeed? We'll know it when we see it, "
Neku,"(Gee, thanks for confiding!)"
Beat,Found ya!
Neku,Who's there!?
Beat,"Get ready to hurt, Phones! You gonna bleed today, yo!"
Neku,Beat... You're OK!
Beat,Better'n OK. See for yourself.
Neku,!? You've got...wings!
Beat,"Pretty badass, huh? Proves I'm a Reaper, yo."
Neku,A Reaper... You really joined them?
Joshua,"Neku, you have Reaper friends, too? My, my. You certainly do get"
Beat,He ain't no friend a' mine. I only came here to erase you punks.
Neku,What? You don't really--
Beat,"Yo, you hear what I said? Bring it!"
Neku,He's...strong...
Beat,"Pfft! That it? Your psychs is limp, yo! I was hopin' for a real fight,"
Neku,"Hey, wait!"
Joshua,"Ugh, talk about your delinquent Reapers. A direct attack on Players"
Neku,Then he's really my enemy now...
Joshua,"If not, he could've fooled me. He wasn't pulling any punches, Neku."
Neku,(But why would he join the Reapers?)
Joshua,"I should be careful, hanging out with you. If that was a friend, I'd"
Neku,So how do you use that thing?
Joshua,"Well, we just walk around with it. It'll tell us when it"
Joshua,"Hold it! Neku, we're getting a response!"
Neku,A response?
Joshua,It means we're close. It's got to be around here.
Neku,Around here where?
Joshua,I don't know... I need to pinpoint this. Let's keep looking around.
Neku,Well?
Joshua,Hmm... It's coming through. Let's look for a stronger 
Reaper,...... Want past this wall? Then turn Natural Puppy into the hottest
Reaper,Objective met. Wall clear!
Joshua,? Hmm?
Neku,"What, pick something up?"
Joshua,Yeah... That.
Neku,What's up with the line?
Joshua,Let's go take a look.
Neku,H-hey! Wait up! What are we even looking for?
Doi,Sigh...
Joshua,"Well, Neku? That ramen shop seems to be the source. Let's"
Neku,Is this a ramen shop?
Joshua,Looks pretty new. My phone says this is the place.
Neku,Here?
Makoto,"Hey! No cutting! Boys, boys, boys... You need to wait in line, same "
Neku,"Uhh, guess we're waiting outside, then."
Joshua,That's no good...
Neku,! Wait... We're invisible outside! We CAN'T wait in line!
Joshua,You're just realizing this now?
Neku,......
Joshua,"Ugh, and the line isn't getting any shorter. The signal's definitely"
Neku,...We've been tracking down ramen?
Joshua,Wouldn't that be a hoot?
Neku,"...... Look, just tell me. What are we after?"
Joshua,......
Neku,...... !? Wait! Do you feel that!?
Ken,I don't get why that place is so popular. The taste is nothing to write
Neku,Negativity. And it's coming from him.
Joshua,He's staring at the line.
Neku,You think something's up with this shop?
Joshua,That might explain the signal I picked up.
Neku,Let's start with the Noise on that guy.
Neku,What's that guy's beef with the new place?
Joshua,Who can say?
Neku,Hmm... Let's try getting rid of the Noise around him.
Ken,One taste! That's all it would take. If people just gave my
Person,"Hey, c'mon! No buttin' in line, kid!"
Joshua,We're not getting in any time soon. Let's try again later.
Ken,Buh! What am I doing out here? I can't afford to sit around complaining!
Neku,He went inside.
Joshua,Let's drop by and talk to him. It's not like this line's going
Neku,"Yeah... (No mission yet, either... Weird.)"
Neku,He went back into his shop.
Joshua,Perfect. We can talk to him there.
Ken,Irasshai!
Neku,"!? (Ugh, what's that smell?)"
Joshua,"I don't see anybody else, but... sounds like he's open."
Ken,What'll you boys have today? We've got a new limited-time-only seasonal
Neku,(What the heck kinda name is that? I'm afraid to ask what's in it. I'll
Joshua,Exciting! Make mine the Big Catch!
Neku,(No way! He's either brave or stupid. )
Joshua,"Him, too."
Neku,(WHAT!?)
Ken,You got it! Here ya go!
Neku,"(What, it's already done!? Is this... food?)"
Joshua,Mmm! ? Fantastic.
Neku,"(Ugh, he's EATING it!)"
Joshua,"Mister, this is excellent!"
Ken,"Like it? Gah ha ha! Ya got good taste, son!"
Joshua,"What's wrong? Eat up while it's hot, Neku."
Neku,...Right. ...... ...... Huh? It's... not terrible... It's actually 
Joshua,Using cheese as a hidden flavor really gives the soup body. The bold
Ken,"For a young kid, you know your noodles! Good to see there are still some"
Neku,"(I'll admit, it's tasty. But...still. Who would order this?)"
Makoto,Hmm? Closed again today?
Neku,! (Another customer?)
Ken,We're OPEN. Can't you see these customers? I can't work with you around.
Makoto,"Ahh, my mistake. The place was so empty, I just assumed. So... Give "
Neku,(It's the guy who bounced us from that other place. ...Why does he look
Ken,I've got nothing to talk about with you. Now get out.
Makoto,"Come on, champ. I need an answer soon. Do yourself a favor and join "
Ken,......
Makoto,What do the people of Shibuya want from a bowl of ramen? It's not
Ken,!!
Makoto,"Anyway, give it some thought. The offer's only open for a month."
Ken,Ha ha.... Sorry you boys had to see that...
Joshua,Are you in some kind of trouble?
Ken,"Heh... Must be, if I got kids asking about it. So, what, you wanna hear"
Neku,(Hear it and do what? We can't help him...) ......
Neku,Shh! What're you--
Shiki,Let's hear him out. Sometimes all people need is a good listener. We
Neku,......
Neku,...... We can listen. But don't expect any miracles.
Ken,"Ha ha, hey, that's more than enough!"
Neku,"Then, uh... go for it."
Ken,"As you can see, business is hardly booming. If I don't turn out some"
Joshua,But that ramen was so good! You're closing?
Ken,"Well, if I let those guys buy me out, I can keep going..."
Neku,But you don't want to?
Ken,"The noodles they serve aren't bad, but... there's no love. They treat"
Fangirls,Eeeeeek!
Neku,What the...
Ken,"Ugh, the show begins... Go on out and see for yourselves."
Fangirls,Eeeeeek!
Fangirls,It's the Prince! He's sooo dreamy!
Neku,"Wait, that's... (The guy I met at 104. Mr. Spicy Tuna Roll or "
Joshua,He went into that other ramen place. Let's go see.
Joshua,They're doing something at that ramen shop. Let's go take a
Neku,(...What exactly is a spicy tuna roll?)
Prince,Exquisite! I can die in bliss. F this ramen! F...for FABULOUS!
Fangirl1,"Omigosh, you hear that!? He F'd it!"
Fangirl2,He only F's the stuff he really likes!
Fangirl1,I want to try what he got!
Neku,That's--
Joshua,"Eiji Oji. The prince of Ennui. His blog ""F Everything"" sees 100,000"
Neku,(...So I've heard.)
Joshua,"When the Prince mentions a place on his blog, this happens. People"
Neku,"Hmph. Well, the noodles do look pretty good..."
Joshua,I'll say. They didn't cut any corners with the presentation.
Neku,"Whoa, what? The staff dance as they cook!?"
Joshua,"I guess it's half food, half show."
Neku,This isn't a theme park...
Joshua,"I see what he meant by ""adventure."""
Prince,"The savory ramen, the eclectic venue-- I know my readers will love it"
Makoto,"Always a pleasure, sir! This month's our grand opening special! Every"
Fangirl1,"Whoa! That's like, super-rare!"
Fangirl2,We seriously all get one!?
Neku,That pin... Yeah. It's the one we promoted for a mission.
Joshua,You don't say...
Neku,"Me and Shiki, we had to make that pin catch on. ! Wait a minute... "
Joshua,"Another friend of yours, Neku?"
Neku,He looks totally different. I hardly recognize him!
Joshua,That's people for you: always quick to do a 180.
Neku,"(Uh, 180? Try a 1260.)"
Joshua,"Still... Interesting. OK, Neku. Let's go."
Neku,Huh?
Joshua,"Stick around, and we'll get yelled at again for cutting."
Makoto,...AHEM.
Neku,Right... Out we go.
Joshua,"My, my, Neku... I believe we have an incident on our hands."
Neku,Huh?
Joshua,"A new ramen shop explodes onto the scene-- its owner, an overnight"
Neku,You think the pins are the source of the energy spike?
Joshua,"Oh! And don't forget the ramen that's not selling. Odd, don't you"
Neku,(Hellooo? You listening? )
Joshua,That settles it. We'll spend today getting to the bottom of this
Neku,"""We""? I'm not about to ignore the mission when--"
Joshua,"What mission, Neku?"
Neku,......
Joshua,"Now, let's start sniffing out the reason this place is such a big "
Joshua,The Dogenzaka Ramen Wars... Hee hee. This is quite a
Neku,......
Joshua,Let's investigate!
Makoto,"Prince, baby. You're killing me."
Prince,Mick...
Makoto,"Gotta obey that contract, hmm?"
Prince,But--
Neku,"! Hey, it's those two."
Joshua,Sounds like trouble in paradise. Let's check it out.
Neku,Sounds like a fight... That promoter's chewing out Spicy Tuna
Joshua,...Spicy what?
Neku,"Oh, uh... never mind. Let's go see what's up."
Makoto,Why'd you change your blog entry?
Prince,I told you. It's my blog. I write it.
Makoto,"I feel you, Prince. I really do. But this is business. Your "
Prince,"But, Mick... Then it's not my blog anymore. Plus the ramen you serve"
Makoto,"Eiji, Eiji, Eiji... Babe. Prince. It's fine! None of those people "
Prince,Mick...
Makoto,I'll send you next text and some pics by tonight. You'll have them up
Prince,......
Neku,Aha.
Joshua,Exactly. Although it looks like the Prince is tired of playing 
Neku,! Hey! The Noise have got him!
Joshua,Hmm... So they do.
Neku,It was all staged? Ugh!
Joshua,"Easy, tiger. The Prince seems ready to turn over a new "
Prince,"Ugh, that beefy ramen makes me broil! All I want is "
Prince,This isn't right. I can't lie to my public. I'll try talking to Mick
Joshua,Even the Prince of Ennui has his woes. I guess we all do.
Neku,Dunno why he's so hung up on ramen.
Joshua,Hee hee. We all have our hang-ups.
Neku,"Ugh, I don't get it."
Joshua,Of course you don't.
Neku,What?
Joshua,Everyone has their own little internal world-- a secret garden only
Neku,"Yeah. (Even if I could, I wouldn't want to see inside other people. "
Makoto,Thank you all for coming out today. We appreciate your patience. As 
Joshua,! Hmm? My phone's responding.
Neku,To those pins!? Is that what you're hunting? Rare pins?
Joshua,Not quite. What I'm looking for isn't a thing.
Neku,...... So... CAT designed these pins?
Joshua,"CAT's the big graphic designer, right?"
Neku,"Yes and no. They do artwork, clothes, even furniture. And that's just "
Joshua,Like the one at Towa Records?
Neku,Yup. CAT doesn't just make art. CAT IS art.
Joshua,You're awfully knowledgeable. Are you a fan?
Neku,"Hell, yes! CAT's all about enjoying every moment, with all you've got. "
Joshua,"Wow, you sound so devoted."
Neku,That's why this pisses me off. He's using CAT's work to trick people.
Ken,I need to outsell that sorry excuse for a ramen shop... I need...
Ken,"(Hmm, what would the kids like?)"
Ken,! Yes! That's it!
Neku,Whoa! Dude ran back into his shop in a hurry.
Joshua,Inspiration must have struck.
Neku,Let's see what he cooks up.
Ken,Irasshai! Hey! I've been waiting for you two. Take a taste! See what you
Joshua,This is...
Neku,Regular old ramen?
Joshua,"Interesting... Well, here goes."
Prince,Hold it!
Joshua,!
Prince,Please... Let me try that.
Joshua,...... Fine...
Prince,"Thank you. Now, to dig in... ...... ...... Amazing! Is it OK for "
Ken,Uhh... Is that a compliment?
Prince,Of course! F for FABULOUS! ...Still. This ramen is exceptional. Let 
guess,"a whole chicken in the soup? That, and a hint of pork bone,"
Ken,It's the same ramen I've always made. Haven't changed a thing. I just
Prince,"Among the flavors, I... I can taste the love you've put in this. Your"
Ken,"Everybody hits rough patches in life. So next time you're down, drop on "
Prince,The future's a clean slate...
Makoto,Ha ha! Try a blank slate pops.
Prince,!?
Makoto,Considering this place is gone in a month.
Prince,What!?
Makoto,"And you... Prince, baby. You're my walking billboard. Can't have you"
Prince,"...... I've come to a decision, Mick. I won't work with you on this "
Makoto,"Babe, babe... Calm down. You're talking crazy, Prince."
Prince,I knew after tasting Sebastian's ramen again. I refuse to be a part 
Makoto,Ugh...Eiji.
Joshua,"Shibuya today is inundated with ""adventure."" And when all anybody"
Neku,Gotta fill more than just your belly.
Ken,"Heh... Love, huh? Guess I forgot that somewhere along the way. I'd harp "
Prince,But you've still got your chalk.
Ken,Heh... Right. I can cook a lotta ramen in one month! I'm stickin' to my
Neku,Hopefully the guy's place will take off.
Joshua,"I was thinking. ""Something different""... Maybe everyone in Shibuya is"
Neku,"Right. You don't want to change, but you don't want to be left behind"
Joshua,Of course not. We can't go through life alone. We're part of a
Neku,"Yeah, and the more people hold you back. Screw living in a world choked"
Joshua,My thoughts exactly. I'd rather just get rid of them.
Neku,What?
Joshua,"Same as you, Neku. Those headphones you wear say it all."
Neku,"(Yeah, so what? I don't like other people. I've got no use for the next"
Joshua,Will you look at the time!
Neku,And still no mission...
Joshua,It's probably too late now. Our little hunt will have to continue
Neku,Huh?
Joshua,The signal's disappearing.
Neku,"But before it was reacting to these pins, right? It's still picking "
Joshua,There was a whole bunch of them before. Maybe they added up to a
Neku,"So why CAT's pin, anyway?"
Joshua,It's not what I'm looking for. I know that...
Neku,OK... Then what ARE you looking for?
Joshua,"Well, put simply..."
Neku,......
Joshua,I'm looking for what this tracker is tracking.
Neku,"(What the... Oh, that's real helpful! What the hell is this kid after?)"
Day,Roamin' the Streeeeets. Chapter Closed]
Neku,......
Joshua,......
Neku,Yesss! I win!
Joshua,"This isn't fair, Neku. When did you suddenly become a Tin Pin expert?"
Neku,And why should I answer that?
Joshua,How about because I'm asking you!? Have you been secretly training?
Neku,"Maybe. Look, a win's a win. That means we wait another hour for the"
Joshua,"Ugh, Neku... Cut me a little slack."
Neku,"Not happening. I won. Therefore, we wait."
Joshua,"Ugh, fine... But this is a huge waste of time. ...... Hello?"
Neku,"(This is getting to him. Keep it up, and he's bound to crack.)"
Konishi,"Today fourteen Players were erased, sir."
Megumi,"Leave it to a genius. At this rate, the Game won't last the week."
Konishi,"About that, sir... No missions have been issued in the last two "
Megumi,None?
Konishi,"None, sir. Nevertheless, Players have been disappearing at a "
Megumi,And Minamimoto?
Konishi,AWOL. He broke off contact yesterday.
Megumi,Our Game Master's gone missing?
Konishi,"His so-called ""works of art"" have been sighted around the UG-- thus, "
Megumi,...Then let's leave him be for now.
Konishi,Meaning you won't require an inquiry into Minamimoto's activities?
Megumi,Correct. He's not a social animal. Give the man some space.
Konishi,"...Understood. As you wish, Mr. Kitaniji."
Megumi,Any other problems?
Konishi,"Several Reapers were attacked on Route 5, sir. We suspect Taboo "
Megumi,Taboo Noise... How does this affect our manpower?
Konishi,The losses are within tolerances. I've already set about identifying
Megumi,Very good. So the Noise explain the dwindling Player count...
Konishi,"Yes, sir. I'm looking into any correlation between the two incidents"
Megumi,"Perfect. I'd expect no less. I leave it to you, Konishi."
Konishi,"Understood, sir."
Konishi,(Sho Minamimoto... A true genius. Youngest Reaper officer in 
Joshua,"How can you be busy, Mr. H? Your café is always empty. ...Fine, fine."
Neku,"(Fifteen minutes and counting... Any minute now, he'll--)"
Joshua,"Say, Neku. Could you do me one teensy favor?"
Neku,"(Bingo. Now, to beat him to the punch.) If this is about the wait, I'm"
Joshua,Fine. How about a trade?
Neku,"(Right on cue!) OK... Answer my question, and I'll go with you."
Joshua,"You've twisted my arm. Go on, shoot."
Neku,...What are you after?
Joshua,You're curious?
Neku,"If you don't feel like talking, we can wait."
Joshua,Hee hee... It's nothing major. I'm going to jack Shibuya.
Neku,...Right. How 'bout a real answer?
Joshua,That was a real answer.
Neku,...... What? How do you jack a town?
Joshua,That's why I'm looking for the Shibuya River.
Neku,What Shibuya River?
Joshua,My turn to ask a question. Do you really want a second chance?
Neku,Huh?
Joshua,What's waiting for you in the RG? You're as alone there as here. 
Neku,......
Joshua,Hee hee. You don't have to answer. I don't really care. Now let's get
Neku,Udagawa!?
Joshua,"Oh, right! You know the city well, Neku."
Neku,Shibuya born and raised.
Joshua,"My, my!"
Neku,"It's coming from Udagawa, right? Let's go."
Joshua,"? Well, this is new... Someone's an eager beaver today."
Neku,"(The Udagawa district... Same place I saw in your head. Along with me,"
Neku,Signal's coming from Udagawa?
Joshua,Yup. Right up Center Street and past Tipsy Tose Hall.
Neku,(Udagawa... What happened to me there?)
Reaper,...... Want past this wall? Then bring me one Sexy +. It's a pin. 
Joshua,Another facile task. 
Neku,I wonder how they come up with them.
Joshua,"The conditions? Probably just on a whim. Anyway, let's find"
Joshua,We've got our pin. Let's get the wall cleared.
Reaper,Objective met. Wall clear!
Reaper,...... Want past this wall? Then fight through a four-reduction chain
Neku,A four-round chain battle...
Joshua,"Nervous, Neku? You can always tone the difficulty down if"
Neku,...Did I ask for advice?
Joshua,"Aww... see, Neku? That wasn't so hard. All you had to do is"
Neku,......
Joshua,"Hee hee. What, would you like a pat on the head?"
Neku,(Rrgh...) How 'bout we just get the wall cleared?
Reaper,...... Objective met. Wall clear!
Joshua,? Hmm? Reaper alert.
Tenho,Let's just report it to the police.
777,"Um, hello? We're metal. And Reapers! No way. We'd lose all our cred!"
BJ,Like you have any after boning this up.
Joshua,Sounds like an argument.
Neku,Sounds like trouble we don't need. Let's ignore them.
Joshua,What could've happened to them?
Neku,I don't even want to know. Let's slip on by.
Joshua,"Are you lost, Neku? Udagawa is up past Tipsy Tose Hall."
Neku,I know where it is.
777,"Hey! Hold up, you two."
Neku,(Ugh... Busted.) ! Wait! You're that--
777,"Hey, my man! I remember you. Perfect timing. You're not busy, right? "
777,"Hey, my man! I remember you!"
Neku,! Wait! You're that--
777,"Perfect timing! You're not busy, right? Help a brother out?"
777,You'll hear me out? Rock!
Joshua,"Ahem. We're booked. Right, Neku? Sorry, but we have somewhere to be."
Neku,Right... Udagawa.
777,"What? Yo, Tenho!"
Neku,"Look, we just need to get through here, and we're kind of in "
777,"Oh yeah? Yo, Tenho!"
Tenho,On it.
Neku,!? What? A wall!? Hey!
777,You wanna get through here? Help us out.
Neku,......
Joshua,Thrusting your person problems on Players? How very professional.
Neku,"Crap, they closed off the road to Udagawa."
Joshua,Then I suppose we're stuck. May as well hear them out.
Neku,"Ugh, this is so not our problem..."
Neku,So what's the deal?
777,Long story short? Our band's microphone has gone missing!
Neku,......
777,"Happened around 2:00 yesterday. We had a little gig at Molco, right? "
BJ,"Yeah, says you. You prob'ly just left it someplace."
777,"I'm tellin' you, BJ, it was stolen! That thing is Def March's heart 'n'"
BJ,Who the hell would want a mic with wings?
777,......
BJ,"Wh-what?! Hey, YOU lost it!"
777,"Ugh... Fine. Let's just split up and look for it, OK?"
Neku,(Why are WE looking for YOUR junk!?)
BJ,"Screw that, man. You lost it. You find it. I'm outta here. ! Oh, Tenho..."
Tenho,"Oh, snap..."
BJ,I found it lyin' around.
Tenho,"Thanks, man. I was wigging out trying to find it. Where was it?"
BJ,"!? In the... uhh, I mean... S-Spain Hill!"
Tenho,......
BJ,I'm headin' back to A-East. Later.
Tenho,I'll go look around Molco again...
777,Thanks!
Neku,I still don't see how this is our problem...
777,"Aww, c'mon. Look, I'll pay ya. Help us out."
Neku,No way! We're--
777,"Here, lemme pay you before I forget!"
Neku,(Ugh! Punk beat me to the draw...)
Joshua,"Well then! Let's begin, hmm? We'll start by gathering"
Neku,(He's enjoying this. The little weirdo is enjoying this. 
Joshua,"Step one is gathering info, starting with the client."
Neku,"(Yoshiya Kiryu, private dick extraordinaire.)"
777,"Hey, boys! Get crackin'."
Neku,Can you give us a little more to go on?
777,Sure! Whaddaya need to know?
Neku,Describe the stolen microphone.
777,It's a stand mic with black wings.
Neku,Black wings?
777,"Yeah, it's the band's symbol."
Neku,Who'd want a bat-mic?
777,I can think of one guy...
Neku,Really!? Who?
777,Freakin' BJ.
Neku,BJ?
777,Guy in the black hoodie? He was just here. He's been whining about 
Neku,"Wait, he stole it because... he wanted to be a vocalist? That makes no"
Neku,What happened when the mic was taken?
777,"I actually didn't tell the other guys, but... just before it "
Neku,A phone call?
777,"Yeah. Thinking back now, it was pretty shady."
Neku,Why was the call shady?
777,"They didn't give me their name... Just, ""Meet me by Cadoi City."" ""We "
Neku,Any guesses?
777,Not really. Called ID said it was a public phone. Sounded like an 
Neku,So... did you go?
777,"Yeah, but nobody was there. When I got back to Molco, the mic was gone."
Neku,That IS shady.
Joshua,So someone called to lure you away. And you think the Reaper in black
777,As much as I hate to consider it...
777,"Well, good luck, guys. I'll be right here."
Neku,(Ugh... What a pain.) So? What now?
Joshua,"Well, it's obvious, isn't it? We investigate the crime scene and"
Neku,"What, have you done this before?"
Joshua,So we've got Molco and the two bandmates. Let's get started.
Joshua,"Next up, the bandmates. The one in black, BJ, went to A-"
Neku,Fine. Let's go talk to them.
Joshua,! Hmm? Isn't that...
Tenho,......
Neku,Let's see what he has to say.
Joshua,"We still have questioning to do. The one in black, BJ, is "
Joshua,Any luck finding the mic?
Tenho,......
Joshua,I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Tenho,"...Sure, whatever."
Joshua,777 said the mic was the band's soul. What makes it so special?
Tenho,"It just is. Back when we were still busking on the streets, we all"
Joshua,I see...
Tenho,But lately 777 and BJ have been fighting over who gets to sing-- over
Joshua,"You must be happy, then-- the object dividing them is out of the"
Tenho,Yeah... ...B-but not that happy! I just... Hmph. Never mind.
Joshua,Where were you yesterday at 2: 00?
Tenho,! ...R-right here?
Neku,(Are you asking us or telling us?)
Joshua,"Ah, yes. BJ said he found your phone on Spain Hill."
Tenho,"Yeah... Must've dropped it here. Well, I don't see our mic here. I'm"
Joshua,You've been very helpful.
Joshua,That takes care of Tenho's testimony. Let's see what BJ has
Neku,......
Joshua,He should be back at A-East. Let's mosey on that way.
Neku,"He said the mic went missing at Molco, right?"
Joshua,Look. A phone booth.
Neku,"Oh, right. 777 said the call came from a pay phone. Then let's--"
Nao,"Hey there! Aren't you, like, Players?"
Joshua,"And you two are... Ahh, yes! The winners of the slam-off."
Nao,"You, like, remember us? Super yay!"
Neku,You need something?
Nao,"So, like, I'm always with the same guy, and I wanted to talk to somebody"
Sota,What're your names?
Joshua,I'm Joshua. This is Neku.
Sota,"Nice meetin' ya, Neku, J-dawg. I'm Sota. The cute one's Nao."
Nao,"Call me Nao-Nao for short, 'K?"
Neku,Uhh... sure.
Sota,"Hey, did you guys know? No missions yesterday or today, but Players are"
Neku,Wiped out?
Nao,"You should be careful, Nekky!"
Neku,N-Nekky?
Nao,"We saw some real scary Noise before? We ran like bunnies! You should,"
Sota,"Let's just all stay sharp and get through this together, huh?"
Neku,"Uh, yeah."
Joshua,Hmm? Didn't you know?
Neku,"Hey, man, don't--"
Joshua,Even if multiple Players survive... only so many get to come back to
Nao,"What? Um, like, uncool?"
Joshua,The other Players aren't your friends. They're your competition. That
Nao,"No way... If, like, two people survive? And only one gets to go back? "
Joshua,"They play again, same as Nekky here."
Neku,......
Nao,"Whoa, like, this is your second time?"
Neku,...Yeah.
Nao,Then your partner made it back!
Neku,No... she didn't.
Nao,Huh? I don't get it.
Neku,She was taken as my entry fee.
Nao,"No way! That's, like, super cruel!"
Neku,"I chose to play again, and she... It's my fault she didn't make it ba--"
Sota,"No worries, man."
Neku,Huh?
Sota,"She was your entry fee, yeah? That means you really care about her. No"
Nao,"Yeah! It's, like, totally not your fault! I'd gladly be Sota's entry fee"
Sota,And I'd play the Game a million times for Nao. Whatever it takes to get
Neku,...... You don't think I'm to blame?
Sota,"Forget blame, man! Plus, I don't care if only one of us gets a second"
Nao,"Yeah! Like, fighting so isn't the answer? We all want to be alive again."
Neku,A pin?
Nao,"Yeah! We, like, won it at the slam-off? And now it's yours. Yay!"
Neku,You sure?
Sota,"We couldn't use it. Not that we're dumping our trash on you, but..."
Neku,Thanks.
Sota,"We should probably move on, yeah?"
Nao,"Be safe, Nekky! Bye, Josh-Josh! Like, see you later?"
Joshua,They were charming.
Neku,Nobody deserves it most...
Joshua,Hmm?
Neku,(It's true... Everybody's got their own deal. Their own dreams. None of
Joshua,Hee hee... Talk about your non sequiturs.
Neku,Sorry... ...So how 'bout we check out that phone?
Joshua,Something went down in that phone booth.
Neku,Right. Let's have a look.
Joshua,"Hmm, no microphones here..."
Neku,"Thank you, Captain Obvious. 777 said the call came from a pay phone. Is"
Joshua,This looks like a job for my phone!
Neku,"...Huh? What, the tracker?"
Joshua,"No, the other new feature."
Neku,What other new feature?
Joshua,The camera.
Neku,Don't most phones already have a camera?
Joshua,"Hee hee... Watch and learn. I simply set the time to yesterday, "
Neku,What and learn what? It's a photo.
Joshua,Hmm... Let's try a different time.
Neku,! Ahh! The mic!
Joshua,So it was right here at this time yesterday.
Neku,What the heck? How did your phone--
Joshua,Weren't you listening to Mr. H? He added a couple of new features.
Neku,"Holy... (That's Mr. H's work? Who the hell IS he?) So, could you shift"
Joshua,Let's try.
Neku,"That's... BJ, right? ! And the mic's gone!"
Joshua,"Hmm, very suspicious."
Neku,"Let's take one more, just to be--"
Joshua,Can't.
Neku,Huh?
Joshua,There's a three-shot-per-day limit.
Neku,What? Why!?
Joshua,How should I know!? Ask Mr. H!
Neku,"(Suddenly, it's a lot less impressive...) Then we'll use mine. ? "
Joshua,Something wrong?
Neku,My phone has no camera.
Joshua,Hmm... He must have forgotten to do yours.
Neku,......
Joshua,!
Neku,Hmm?
Joshua,Isn't that...
BJ,Sigh... I thought for sure it'd work.
Neku,Let's see what he has to say.
Joshua,We still have questioning to do. We've already talked to
BJ,Sigh...
Joshua,AHEM.
BJ,!! Gah! Wh-what!?
Joshua,Weren't you headed back to A-East?
BJ,...... ...I wanted to lose myself in the crowd for a bit. Y'know?
Neku,"(Can't say that I do, actually.)"
Joshua,We just had a few questions for you.
BJ,"Look, what do you want?"
Joshua,About the stolen mic--
BJ,Stolen? Please. 777's full of it. I'm sure he just left it someplace.
Joshua,I hear that you wanted that mic for yourself.
BJ,So what if I did? Doesn't matter now. I don't need it anyway.
Joshua,Where were you yesterday at 2:00?
BJ,"! Oh, uh... I was... You know, uhh ...Dogenzaka! Yeah! In line for the "
Joshua,Mm-hmm...
BJ,"Wh-what? Just gimme some space, would ya? I want to spend some time "
Joshua,Of course. But first... take a look at this photo.
BJ,Wha-- How did--
Joshua,That's the phone booth near Molco. Aka the phone booth of love.
BJ,Gah!
Joshua,Isn't there some kind of urban legend? They say if you use this phone
BJ,"Oh, um... really!?"
Joshua,I don't know who you called. But you were there yesterday. That much 
BJ,But I--
Joshua,You weren't in Dogenzaka. You were chatting up some tramp near Molco.
BJ,She's NOT a tramp!
Neku,"(Damn, Josh.... Remind me not to tick you off.)"
BJ,"You can't tell ANYONE about this! OK, so I was there yesterday! I made a"
Joshua,"Quite. You've been very helpful, thanks."
BJ,Ugh... I'm headin' back to see 777. Hopefully he's found the stupid mic 
Joshua,I don't think we're getting anything else out of him. Let's move on.
Neku,"Well, we've heard from everybody."
Joshua,"Yes, it would seem our profile is complete."
Neku,Uhh...what?
Joshua,Hee hee. You'll see. Let's head back to Tipsy Tose Hall.
777,"Well, if we haven't found it by now... it's probably not turning up. "
Joshua,Not so fast...
777,Huh?
Joshua,I think I've identified your thief.
777,You serious!?
Neku,"Wait, what?"
Joshua,"Hee hee. Let's recap, hmm? The theft occurred yesterday at 2:00. 777"
BJ,What phone call?
Joshua,"""Meet me by Cadoi City. We need to talk."" The microphone was stolen"
Tenho,......
Joshua,"According to 777's caller ID, the call originated at a public phone."
BJ,! What!? Y-you guys aren't gonna--
Joshua,This photo shows... Neku?
Neku,"What, I'M telling them!? Uhh, this photo tells it all..."
777,Wait... BJ!?
BJ,I told you not to say anything!
777,So it WAS you who called me!
Joshua,"Whoa there. When did you get that call? Precisely, that is."
777,"Uhh, lemme check... 1:40."
Joshua,Take a closer look at the photo. See? It was taken at 2:02. BJ used 
BJ,......
Joshua,"No, he was calling a lady friend, hmm? To whisper sweet nothings in"
BJ,AHHHHH! ...... OK! OK! I admit-- I told a chick I like her! And she
Joshua,"...... Deep breath, Beej. That isn't the point of the photo. Look"
777,Hmm? Is that a cell phone?
Joshua,Certainly looks like it. But not BJ's.
777,I don't get it...
Joshua,"Look at this photo. Would you do the honors, Neku?"
Neku,......
Joshua,"Neku, Neku, Neku... The OTHER photo."
Neku,......
777,The one of the mic? What about it?
Joshua,Ignore the microphone. Look on top of the telephone.
777,It's that cell phone!
Joshua,"Correct. It was there when BJ arrived. He saw it, and took it. Now, "
BJ,Cause it belonged to... ! Waaait a minute!
Joshua,You knew the owner. So you picked it up and returned it.
BJ,"Oh, Tenho... This your phone, bro?"
Tenho,"Oh, snap..."
BJ,I found it lyin' around.
Tenho,"Thanks, man. I was wigging out trying to find it. Where was it?"
BJ,"!? In the... uhh, I mean... S-Spain Hill!"
777,Tenho!? But...but... BJ said he found the cell on Spain... ! Ohhhhhh.
Joshua,BJ didn't want anyone finding out he got blown off. So he lied about
Tenho,"...... I'm sorry, guys. It was all me."
777,"What? Why, man!?"
Tenho,I thought it'd stop you two fighting. I don't want us to break up...
777,"...... Sorry, bro. We put you through a lot, huh?"
BJ,"Yeah, my bad, Tenho. I was outta line about wantin' to do vocals..."
777,"...... But that's all over now, right!? We good again?"
BJ,"Heh, I'm cool."
777,"Good. Now let's have that mic, Tenho..."
Tenho,"It, uhh... It kinda got stolen."
777,WHAT!?
Tenho,"I called 777 from that phone booth. Once he left, I grabbed the mic. I"
777,Gone?
Tenho,Yeah. This was in there in its place...
777,A megaphone?
Tenho,With some freaky stuff recorded in it...
Tenho,......
777,......
BJ,......
Tenho,"I'm sorry, guys! I just wanted us to stay together! Now, because of"
Neku,(That megaphone could only belong to one person.)
Joshua,Hee hee... Fascinating. It seems this mystery runs deeper! Care to
Neku,No brainer. The guy who took the mic is...
Joshua,"Hee hee. You can tell them the truth, Neku. Now let's have"
Neku,None of these guys.
Tenho,Meet me by Cadoi City. We need to talk.
Tenho,...... Now's my chance!
Tenho,"Oh, crap! 777! Gah! Gotta hide! ...... Whew..."
Tenho,Hmm? My phone?
Tenho,"Ugh... Be right back, mic. Stay put."
Minamimoto,"! Hmm? Why, hello! This mic is zetta sexy! Perfect for my opus!"
BJ,OK. OK. Let's do this. I'm gonna tell her. I'm gonna... ! Huh? That's
BJ,...Sniff. Phone booth of love my ass!
Tenho,"! Now, to pick up the-- Gah! It's gone!? ...The hell is this "
777,Great story. Now where's our mic?
Joshua,Hmm... Knowing him? In that junk heap over there.
777,What!?
BJ,Our baby is in that pile of trash!?
777,"Start digging, boys!"
Tenho,...... Sorry to drag you guys into this. I cleared the wall. Go on.
Joshua,Best of luck.
Joshua,"Now then! Shall we head to Udagawa, Neku?"
Neku,That was the detour from hell...
Joshua,"Well, the road is open. Let's leave them to their fishing"
Neku,...Right.
Beat,Gotchu punks.
Neku,!
Beat,"Hope you brought your A-game today, yo."
Neku,Beat... Don't do this. I don't want to fight you.
Beat,"Beggin' won't work, yo!"
Neku,"Look, I have to win! For Shiki, too! So would you please go away!?"
Beat,Shut it! Le's jus' do this!
Neku,(Nngh... That's about all I've got...)
Beat,"Yo yo yo, you even tryin'? Hit harder! I barely felt that! Man, y'all "
Joshua,Whew... That was pretty close.
Neku,......
Joshua,He's serious. He must really not like you.
Neku,"...... (I could see him hating me. ...But why erase Shiki, too? Is he"
Joshua,"Hmm? What's this, Neku?"
Neku,A pendant? ! (This was Rhyme's.) Beat must've dropped it.
Joshua,I guess so.
Neku,"(He's no genius, but he must've had a reason to join them. This meant a"
Joshua,We can get through to Udagawa now. ...About time.
Neku,(About time is right. Now I can find out what that memory's 
Joshua,"Know Udagawa well, Neku?"
Neku,Yeah. I used to come here after school.
Joshua,With your friends?
Neku,Please. I don't do groups. I never met anyone fun to be around.
Joshua,"Hee hee. Me neither. We seem to have a lot in common. You know, "
Neku,Where did that come from!?
Joshua,"The UG is split into different areas. Shibuya's just one of them, "
Neku,Mr. H told you all that?
Joshua,"...Oh, so you know about our conversations."
Neku,......
Joshua,"As I was saying, every area has its own rules. They never meddle with"
Neku,That could apply to anyone.
Joshua,"Hee hee... Maybe so. As long as we all have our own worlds, people "
Neku,"Right? They're them, and I'm me. Talking to them gets me nothing. I"
Joshua,"""Do what you want, how you want, when you want it,"" was it?"
Neku,"Yeah. It blew me away. CAT was living the life I always wanted to, but"
Joshua,Absolutely. Who needs other people's values? It's easier to just live
Neku,"Yeah... (But... I don't feel that way anymore. Since coming to the UG,"
Joshua,Yoo-hoo? Neku?
Neku,......
Joshua,"Well, we may be stuck in Shibuya. But you can still see a fair ways."
Neku,......
Joshua,"Hee hee. That mural you mentioned is up ahead, right? The signal's"
Joshua,The signal's coming from further back. Shall we?
Neku,......
Minamimoto,3 is the point of the 1.
Joshua,!
Minamimoto,4 the 1-5-9 are 2.
Neku,"! Hey, it's..."
Joshua,Shh! Let's see what he's up to.
Minamimoto,"6-5, 3-5! 8-9, 7-9! 32384 62643 38327! And... perfect. Soon... "
Neku,What was all that about?
Joshua,This is...
Neku,"Vandalism? He drew it just now, right? More of his loony art?"
Joshua,I wonder... My phone's responding to it.
Neku,To these scribbles? I thought you were looking for the Shibuya River.
Joshua,I am.
Neku,Uhh... I don't see any rivers.
Joshua,"Thank you, Neku. ...What IS this? Considering the artist, it can't be"
Neku,Well? Should we erase it?
Joshua,"He'll know. Besides, it could be a trap. Let's leave it for now. "
Neku,(Now's the best time. If I take him to where I was lying on the
Joshua,"Say, Neku?"
Neku,Wh-what?
Joshua,I'd like to check over by that mural. Do you mind?
Neku,Uh...sure. (The weasel beat me to it... What's he need over there?)
Uzuki,"Ugh, finally!"
Kariya,"Deep breath, girl."
Uzuki,Don't give me that! Why'd those two brats have to show up? They're so 
Kariya,Uzuki... Get on the horn with HQ. Now.
Uzuki,What? Why?
Kariya,That's a Taboo Noise refinery sigil.
Uzuki,That!? I never knew what they looked like... So the GM's gone 
Kariya,Not quite. This sigil still hasn't been used. There must be another
Uzuki,"...Do you smell that, Kariya? Promotions! Glory!"
Kariya,"I'll pass. Instead of buyin' me that bowl of ramen, you can just take"
Uzuki,"What, you're too lazy to even claim credit?"
Kariya,Something like that. 'Sides... I may have another mystery to unravel.
Neku,(What is he thinking? ......)
Joshua,Impressive graffiti.
Neku,It's CAT's. This is my favorite spot. (And the spot where I died in 
Joshua,"Still with me, Neku?"
Neku,Huh?
Joshua,You spaced out.
Neku,Oh... Sorry.
Joshua,You've giving me déjà vu.
Neku,What!? (Déjà vu? From when? Did... did you really see me die!? Were 
Neku,(...... I need to know. Gotta scan him...)
Neku,(I... It was here.)
Joshua,"Something wrong, Neku?"
Neku,(He... He killed me!)
Joshua,Hello?
Neku,...I'm here. Just a little dizzy. I'm fine.
Joshua,"Good. Let's move on. Nothing else to see here. Ugh, this tracker's"
Neku,(How can he act so normal around a guy he killed? He sought me out as a
Day,Pinned. Chapter Closed]
Joshua,"Hello? Yeah, Mr. H? It's me. You gave me a bum tracker!"
Neku,(He killed me... Why? What would he stand to gain? Fastest way is just 
Joshua,"There's no mission today either. Yeah, we can get there. Something "
Neku,(Three more days with him. He's a loose cannon. I need to watch my 
Joshua,"You better! OK, thanks. Later."
Neku,(This is for Shiki. I can last a few more days.)
Joshua,All set?
Neku,"First, I have a question."
Joshua,"Oh? What is it today, Neku?"
Neku,What are you after?
Joshua,This again? I told you. I'm jacking Shibuya.
Neku,But what does that mean? You're looking for some river. Then what? Tell
Joshua,...... Sigh... Fine. I'll keep this simple. Remember who's in charge 
Neku,The Composer.
Joshua,Very good. Right now HE'S got Shibuya jacked. Under his control. I 
Neku,Change it? ...Wait. You want to bust in on the Composer with guns
Joshua,Eventually. I have to find him first. He should be at the Shibuya
Neku,So it's the Composer... We've been running around Shibuya looking for
Joshua,"With a busted tracker, yes."
Neku,"...... ! Wait, so the Grim Heaper's been after..."
Joshua,"Me, most likely. I guess he's onto me."
Neku,"Ugh, just what I need. I'm in this to win! I can't afford any "
Joshua,Neither can I.
Neku,"(Then why are you... Ugh, this kid is the devil!)"
Joshua,Ready to go to Mr. H's?
Neku,What for?
Joshua,To get him to fix this glitchy tracker.
Neku,You're still going after the Composer?
Joshua,Of course. Now come on. You've asked your question.
Neku,......
Uzuki,"So, Kariya. What's this big mystery you mentioned yesterday?"
Kariya,"Oh, just Phones and the petit prince."
Uzuki,Those two? What about 'em?
Kariya,We're about to go find out.
Uzuki,"Wait, find out how? It's hands off the Players. GM's orders, remember?"
Kariya,"So I'll use my head. Besides, we're just going to play a little game."
Uzuki,...... And that's different how?
Kariya,Details.
Uzuki,"Well, I'm stinkin' bored. Count me in!"
Neku,......
Joshua,"Well, Neku? Let's go see Mr. H. I hope you haven't "
Neku,Past Cadoi City and Towa Records.
Joshua,"Very good, Neku! Oh, I'm so proud."
Neku,......
Joshua,So get moving.
Neku,There's the Moyai Statue again.
Joshua,"Say, Neku... Do you know how the statue got here?"
Neku,No clue.
Joshua,Well... It was a gift. The island of Niijima
Neku,No kidding.
Joshua,"Just like you and me, Neku. The very picture of ""moyai."""
Neku,......
Kariya,Whoa there.
Neku,! Huh?
Kariya,"Hey, kids. How goes?"
Neku,You're... What do you want?
Kariya,You up for a little game?
Neku,Excuse me?
Joshua,"Look, we're busy here."
Kariya,"Zing! Where's the love? Yo, Uzuki."
Uzuki,On it!
Neku,Huh?
Uzuki,Wall's up! Sowwy.
Neku,Hey!
Kariya,Now then... Game on? I think so!
Neku,Rrgh... Great.
Neku,"Dammit, what did they want?"
Joshua,My guess is they've set up walls along Route 2... all the 
Neku,(There's no mission! Why screw us over?)
Joshua,"Oh, well. We'll just have to play along."
Reaper,...... Passage denied. Pick another route.
Reaper,...... Want past this wall? Then turn D+B into the hottest thing
Neku,Make it number one?
Joshua,You seem a little lost.
Neku,We just gotta wear D+B pins and items into combat.
Joshua,"Wow, I'm... I'm a little surprised. I didn't think fashion"
Neku,(Shiki taught me.)
Joshua,"I see... Well, let's take care of this."
Neku,OK. D+B's on top of the charts. ...... Uhh... What's with all
Joshua,"Hee hee. Behold, the power of trends. Now, let's get that"
Reaper,Objective met. Wall clear!
Reaper,YAAAWN. ...I'm so over this whole wall thing. Today was supposed to 
Neku,He wants ramen? Hmm... There was the guy's shop on Dogenzaka.
Joshua,"Hee hee. Have you ever been to the beach, Neku?"
Neku,...Yes.
Joshua,"If you got a mouthful of ocean, it would taste..."
Neku,Uhh... salty? !
Joshua,"Very good! So, which flavor of ramen is salty?"
Neku,Ahh... Got it.
Neku,Dogenzaka... That guy's ramen shop was around here.
Joshua,"Say, Neku... Do you know where Dogenzaka got its name?"
Neku,Nope.
Joshua,And you call yourself a local.
Neku,......
Joshua,"There are two stories. One attributes the name to Owada Dogen, a"
Neku,You don't say.
Joshua,The other story claims the name comes from a temple. Dogenzaka also
Neku,Can't say that I have.
Joshua,"You should. I mean, just think! You're walking through the pages of"
Neku,I feel so epic.
Joshua,"...... Sigh... Neku, is any of this sinking in?"
Neku,"Oh, yeah."
Joshua,You sure? ...... All right. Pop quiz. Name the bandit who gave
Joshua,"No, Neku. Wrong. Someone forgot to put on his good listener"
Neku,......
Joshua,Very good! What an excellent listener.
Neku,Yup. That's me...
Reaper,"! Ooh, you brought it! ...Ugh. Where'd you get it? It looks foul. "
Reaper,...... Passage denied. Pick another route.
Reaper,"...... Miss me? Like a bolt from the blue, it's time for the Reaper"
Reaper,If you say so... Question 2! What's the secret menu item he only 
Reaper,"I know, right? Question 3! How much will a bowl of shio ramen run you"
Reaper,Aha! I see what you did there. OK... The results are in! Reaper 
Reaper,Bzzzt! So sorry! I can't let you pass-- until you pass. 
Neku,"Ugh, and we were just there! Remember... C'mon, remember!"
Joshua,"Hmm... Well, no sense beating your head against a wall. "
Reaper,"...... Did you do your homework, kids? Then away we go! "
Reaper,You pass! So pass on through. But! Though you may forget the Review--
Uzuki,"Ugh... And here I got my hopes up! THIS was your game? Booo-ring! So,"
Kariya,Wrong kid.
Uzuki,"What, you're eyeing the snobby one? What about him?"
Kariya,"Oh, you'll see..."
Reaper,...... Want past this wall? Heh heh heh. ...You. Orangeylocks.
Neku,Me?
Reaper,"Yeah, you! Come back wearing all Mus Rattus threads. Do that, and "
Neku,"Mus Rattus, huh?"
Joshua,That's the bargain brand that's branched out all over 
Neku,"Me? Wear that? Ugh, I hate these walls..."
Neku,"All right, I'm a walking ball of Rat. Can we get that wall"
Joshua,Pfft... Snrrk!
Neku,Can I help you?
Joshua,"Oh, no. I'm just fine. Ready to go... Ratty McRatterson?"
Neku,Happy now?
Reaper,"Pfft! Aha ha... What a chintzy outfit, man! It suits you."
Neku,...Excuse me!?
Reaper,Objective met. Wall clear!
Joshua,"Hee hee... He said it suits you, Neku."
Neku,I heard him!
Tenho,...... Want past this wall? Play me at Tin Pin! You ready? Here we go!
Tenho,"C'mon, hurry up!"
Neku,He wants to play Tin Pin? That's his big demand?
Joshua,"Aww, indulge the poor man. Let's see those moves from the"
Neku,......
Tenho,Here we go!
Tenho,...Crap. Is there NOBODY in this world I can actually beat!? Sigh...
Tenho,Woo hoo! My first victory! Thanks for sucking so bad. Wall
Reaper,...... Want past this wall? Then here. Defeat these Noise! ...BUT. I
Reaper,What's the holdup?
Neku,Take a deep breath? What's THAT supposed to mean?
Joshua,Hee hee... It means some pins react to curious things.
Reaper,Then here we go!
Reaper,Objective met. Wall clear!
Kariya,And you're done. Thanks for playin'.
Neku,......
Kariya,Later!
Neku,...... What was that about?
Joshua,Who knows. What a waste of time.
Neku,What the hell was all that about?
Joshua,"Who knows. Anyway, the road's open. Let's go see Mr. H."
Uzuki,...Well? Figure anything out?
Kariya,Maybe.
Uzuki,Can you be a little more specific?
Uzuki,"Ugh, sorry... Yashiro here. ...... Taboo Noise? ...All right."
Kariya,Hmm?
Uzuki,Another Taboo Noise sighting.
Kariya,Lovely. Where at?
Uzuki,HQ lost sight of 'em on Dogenzaka. Well? Let's go!
Kariya,Go where?
Uzuki,"What do you mean, where? After them!"
Kariya,You said HQ lost sight of 'em. Are we supposed to wander around all
Uzuki,Got a better plan?
Kariya,Let those kids be the bait. Then we just tag along until the Taboo
H,"Oh, hey guys. Let's see that phone."
Joshua,Thanks. It's been responding to most of Shibuya.
H,I'll have it fixed in a jiffy. Sit tight.
Joshua,"Ah! Neku's phone, too. The camera."
H,Right. Got it.
Joshua,......
Neku,......
Joshua,......
Neku,...... (Why did he do it? Why would he want me dead? He's trying to 
Joshua,"Hmm? What's this, now?"
Neku,"When we first met, you said you'd been watching me. What does that "
Joshua,...... Ahh. So that's what this is all about.
Neku,(Rrgh...)
Joshua,I've always been able to see the UG.
Neku,(This is the freaky ability Hanekoma mentioned?) Even when you were
Joshua,"That's right. Lucky me, right? I saw things others couldn't. I knew"
Neku,So you were watching me from the RG.
Joshua,The Game intrigued me. I was following it on my own when I met Mr. H.
Neku,When was that?
Joshua,"Oh, years ago. So I became a regular at his shop, listening to his"
Neku,What charm?
Joshua,People racing across the city in a life-or-death struggle? Find me
Neku,So you... came here?
Joshua,Yeah. I decided I belonged in the UG.
Neku,"...... And you thought I did, too?"
Joshua,...Hmm?
Neku,You want to be here? Fine. But not me. You ki--
H,All done!
Joshua,Really? Let's have a look.
Neku,Dammit!
H,That do it before I head out?
Joshua,Oh? Where are you going?
H,"Just a little errand. Shop's closed for today. Later, boys. 2-3, 2-"
Joshua,"...... Well, the tracker's fixed. Shall we? Oh, before we do... Neku?"
Neku,What?
Joshua,"My turn. I suffered through your questions, didn't I? Now I have one"
Neku,...What?
Joshua,"How'd you die, Neku?"
Neku,"What? You tell me, ass-- (No. ...Two more days. He wants me to play it"
Joshua,Don't know? Is that even possible?
Neku,"My memory was the entry fee last Game. Most of it's back, but... there"
Joshua,Hee hee... Not telling ?
Neku,"What? (Ugh, nice.)"
Joshua,I'm here because I want to be. End of story. Ready to go?
Neku,(The questions bounce right off him. I can't afford to get into a 
Joshua,"...Are you listening, Neku? The signal's coming from the scramble"
Neku,......
Neku,(Hmm... He won't break easily...)
Joshua,"What's the holdup, Neku? We've got a signal to follow. It's"
Beat,"Yo, Phones."
Neku,!! Beat...
Beat,You man up any yet? 'Cause I don't believe in hittin' women an' 
Neku,Why are you doing this?
Beat,You stupid? I'm a Reaper.
Joshua,Don't be silly. Reapers aren't allowed to--
Beat,"""Reapers ain't allowed at, Mommy! Wah wah wah!"" Shut it! This Reaper's"
Uzuki,Are you daft!?
Neku,It's them!
Kariya,"Hey, no touchy, Freshmeat. Rules are rules. Reapers can't attack"
Uzuki,"Yeah, and we're all on standby. GM's orders. Leave the Players alone."
Beat,"I'm special! I'm runnin' a special op for the Conductor, yo."
Uzuki,Special op!?
Kariya,"My, my! A rising star, are we?"
Beat,"That's right, Lolly. Twinkle twinkle."
Uzuki,Ugh! Why'd he pick you? I have seniority!
Beat,"Beats me. Now you senior citizens can hobble off, aight?"
Uzuki,Aaargh! Cocky little punk!
Kariya,"C'mon, girl, take it with dignity. Let's leave the kids in peace. "
Beat,"Pfft, whatever. Aight, Phones, le's dance!"
Beat,Urg... Now that's more like it.
Neku,"Beat, stop! You dropped--"
Beat,"I'ma drop YOU, hard!"
Neku,Will you STOP!? This pendant is yours.
Beat,"!? That's... Hey! Low blow, man!"
Neku,"You dropped it the other day, Beat."
Beat,"Yeah, sure. Now gimme it back! If you think you can use that to "
Neku,No bargains! Here. It's yours.
Beat,"...... ...Why'd you gimme it? We enemies, yo."
Neku,"It's important to you, isn't it?"
Beat,...... Hmph. Dontchu be expectin' any thanks.
Neku,"(...Bye, Beat.)"
Joshua,Is the delinquent Reaper gone? Hmm... A special op...
Neku,What about it?
Joshua,"Oh, nothing. Let's go."
Neku,(Beat...)
Joshua,"Such a bother. Ah, well. Let's keep moving."
Neku,This is CAT's latest...
Joshua,"Shibuya's full of his stuff, hmm? It must take a ton of time. I'm"
Neku,Huh? CAT opened a café? Where? In Shibuya?
Joshua,"You feeling alright, Neku? How many times have you been there now?"
Neku,What!? Where the heck is it?
Joshua,"Cat street, silly."
Neku,Cat... ! No way!
Joshua,"Yes, way. CAT is Mr. H."
Neku,"NO WAY! Mr. Hanekoma!? Is CAT!? Whoa...whoa! OK, calm down."
Joshua,Hee hee. I'll try.
Neku,Mr. H? Seriously? I don't believe it!
Joshua,How did you not know this? I thought you were CAT's biggest fan.
Neku,"He never does interviews in person. He's never released any photos,"
Joshua,"Hee hee. I'm happy you're happy. Just don't tell him where you heard,"
Neku,"I won't. (So, if Hanekoma is CAT... That means he's... CAT's NOT the"
Joshua,I still don't get why he's so popular. It's just street art.
Neku,"CAT's work all follow a single, consistent aesthetic. And he keeps the"
Joshua,I see.
Neku,That's tougher than it sounds.
Joshua,Is it? I bet you'd have little trouble.
Neku,Huh?
Joshua,Use your Player Pin.
Neku,What's this got to do with--
Joshua,"If you know what people are thinking, it's easy to grab them."
Neku,It... it would be an advantage.
Joshua,Right. Why bother with talk? With sifting through the lies we all 
Neku,"It's true. We're not mean to see eye to eye. (But... I dunno, maybe "
Joshua,"You OK, Neku?"
Neku,"Yeah, I could try to be CAT with this pin. But why? Where's the "
Joshua,...... Neku... Hee hee. Your face is priceless.
Neku,Huh? (Who asked you!?)
Joshua,"Anyway, we really should make for the scramble. We may not be getting"
Neku,(Him and his Composer hunt... He's really serious? Kid's crazy. He's on
Neku,(So Mr. H is CAT. What a relief...)
Joshua,......
Neku,"(What about this kid, though? Is he really planning a coup?"
Joshua,Hold it. I'm getting a signal. It's coming from--
Neku,Wait a minute. You want to take on the Composer.
Joshua,Haven't we been over this?
Neku,"Look, I'm done with it. I have to win this Game. I'm not taking on any"
Joshua,...... Fine. I won't ask you to get involved. At least let me 
Neku,"...... OK, but that's it."
Joshua,Hee hee. You're so generous. The signal's coming from the station
Joshua,"Umm, Neku? I thought we were going to the station "
Neku,We will.
Joshua,You don't have to worry. All we're doing is locating the
Joshua,"Good, the signal is coming in stronger. We're heading in "
Neku,......
Joshua,And here we are.
Neku,So the river is up ahead? This is where the Composer is?
Joshua,Hee hee. We shall see.
Neku,...Here?
Joshua,Looks like the tracker's working now. Welcome to the Shibuya River.
Neku,Since when is there a river here? That's news to me.
Joshua,The Composer's just ahead.
Neku,......
Joshua,! ......
Neku,...What?
Joshua,We're blocked out.
Neku,This is the end of the line?
Joshua,Unless we get rid of that wall. Let's head back and gather more info.
Neku,(Gather it where? Who the hell'd know about this?)
Neku,(A way through that wall? How the heck does he plan on 
Neku,We found your river. Satisfied?
Joshua,For now.
Neku,What the...
Joshua,Noise? The same kind as before!
Neku,Get ready!
Neku,Did we kill it!?
Joshua,Apparently not... Looks like we're outmatched.
Neku,Rrgh! I can't give up now...
Joshua,"...... Oh, all right... I was hoping to avoid this."
Neku,Holy... Since when can you do THAT!?
Joshua,"I told you, I hate working up a sweat."
Kariya,Braaa-vo!
Neku,Who's there!?
Kariya,"Afternoon, kids. ...Hey, pretty boy. You're ALIVE, ain't ya?"
Neku,What!?
Kariya,That was one helluva blast. No way a Player could do that. You don't
Neku,No!
Kariya,But... I won't.
Neku,Huh?
Kariya,"Too much work. 'Sides, that Noise was givin' us hell, too. So let's"
Joshua,"...Whew. Lucky us, huh, Neku?"
Neku,Joshua... Was that true? You're alive?
Joshua,"...... Cat's out of the bag. Yes, Neku. I'm playing the Game alive."
Neku,You're... But how can...
Joshua,There's a loophole to everything. Sneaking in means I don't have a
Neku,So you just--
Joshua,"Please, it's not a big deal. We formed a valid pact. We're just like"
Neku,...No.
Joshua,Hmm? I didn't catch that.
Neku,"No, we're not, you punk! How can you say you're the same as us? You're"
Joshua,"No, you're playing because you want to live again. You still get"
Neku,You little bastard... Only what you TOOK from me! YOU killed me!
Joshua,"Aww, Neku. You said you didn't remember! You sneaky little thing. So"
Neku,What!?
Joshua,What if I am the one who killed you? You're going to do something 
Day,Turf. Chapter Closed]
Neku,"Back at the scramble again... (One more day down. Hey, where's...)"
Joshua,"Yeah, we found it. We just can't get in."
Neku,(On the phone... Mr. H again? Why would he help this kid? Does he know
Joshua,"All right. I'll call you. Morning, sunshine."
Neku,"Har har. You're killing me, Josh. Oh, wait..."
Joshua,"Again, say it was me. What are you going to do?"
Neku,That's easy! I'll--
Joshua,Erase me?
Neku,Don't tempt me.
Joshua,"Oh, please. We're partners, you and I. If I go, you're dead in the"
Neku,Rrgh! (You smug little piece of snot! You knew that going into all 
Neku,"! Gah! Mail? A mission!? ""Game VI: Beat the bosses of 2.2360679's 0+5."
Joshua,The bosses of 0+5... Meaning two fights?
Neku,Is 2.23 whatever code for something?
Joshua,Let's leave that for now. First let's see where we have access to.
Neku,You're sure into this today. What do you care about missions?
Joshua,"I care plenty, Neku. I am a Player."
Neku,You're alive.
Joshua,"Maybe so, but I'm still a Player. If I'm erased here in the UG, the "
Neku,Then why put yourself in danger?
Joshua,Beats staying in the RG. Now let's go.
Neku,Wait. Don't think for a minute I've forgiven you. I'll put up with you 
Joshua,"Hee hee. Yes, sir."
Joshua,The bosses of 2.2360679's 0 + 5... Even I'm at a bit of a
Joshua,"Neku, look out!"
Neku,!? Wha--
Neku,Why'd that Noise attack?
Joshua,Just like yesterday. They attack without any provocation. Some new 
Neku,!! Behind you!
Joshua,Hmm!?
Neku,Wh-what just happened?
Joshua,...... It seems we owe someone for saving us.
Neku,Who? (...Beat?)
Joshua,"Either way, we were lucky. I shouldn't have been so careless. Stay"
Joshua,Since when do Noise instigate fights?
Neku,"Yeah, weird."
Joshua,Looks like today may be eventful. Let's watch our backs.
Neku,What's up with the Noise today? They're acting so strange...
Joshua,There are generally two types of Noise. Strays that emerge from
Neku,The Grim Heaper's out for blood?
Joshua,Most likely.
Neku,"Ugh. (Well, he can bring it on.) Let's go!"
Reaper,Gyaaah!
Neku,!! Look!
eaper,The hell is up with this Noise!?
Neku,A Reaper. He's being attacked by Noise!
Joshua,"Well, Neku?"
Neku,We've gotta help him!
Joshua,If you say so.
Neku,More!?
Joshua,These'll have to come first. He'll have to tough it out till then.
Neku,Rrgh! Hurry!
Neku,That Reaper! Where'd he...
Joshua,......
Neku,......
Joshua,"Gone, I'm afraid."
Neku,We left him to die...
Joshua,"We did what we had to, Neku."
Neku,......
Joshua,Still... Why was that Noise attacking a Reaper?
Neku,Do Noise made by Reapers not attack them?
Joshua,"That's what I'd heard, anyway... ......"
Neku,"What the hell are these, then?"
Neku,Let's make a break for it.
Joshua,Wise choice.
Reaper,Yeaaaugh!
Neku,...... That Reaper... He's...
Joshua,"That's not your concern, Neku. Let's move along."
Neku,......
Joshua,"You shouldn't feel bad, Neku. You didn't know him."
Neku,......
Joshua,Now let's get going.
Neku,We don't have any time to waste. Let's hurry.
Joshua,A wise choice.
Neku,Man... What ARE those things?
Joshua,"It looks like the Reapers are having a time of it, too."
Neku,"(Whatever they are, they're not stopping me.)"
Neku,!! Look!
Sota,Nngh! More of 'em?
Nao,"Sota, sorry... I can't..."
Sota,Nao! Stay with me! We're finishing this thing together!
Nao,I'd... love to... but it... doesn't look like I can. Sorry... Sota...
Sota,Nao!
Sota,Nao! Dammit... DAMMIT!
Neku,No!
Joshua,"Without a partner... he won't be far behind. Well, Neku? Do we help "
Neku,......
Neku,You have to ask!? Let's go!
Neku,"We have to keep... Urg, no!!! I can't just leave him!"
Sota,Nngh! Nao... Looks like I won't be far behind ya. !? Huh? Aren't you--
Neku,"We'll handle this! C'mon, Joshua!"
Joshua,I'm ready.
Neku,You OK?
Sota,"Yeah... You saved my ass. Heh, for now, anyway. I lost Nao... I don't"
Neku,If... if we'd gotten here sooner--
Sota,"Ain't your fault, dawg. I wasn't strong enough. End of story. Neku and"
Neku,Yeah.
Sota,You two survive. Get your old partner back. I hope all three of ya get
Neku,"Augh!!! We were too late! They were right there, but... I couldn't do a"
Joshua,We may be the last pair. Let's stay sharp.
Neku,Friggin' Reapers!
Joshua,Angry?
Neku,"Hell yes, I'm angry!"
Joshua,At least you're still in the Game.
Neku,Yeah? What about the people who aren't? Screw the Game! These are 
Joshua,Why the sudden interest? I didn't think you cared about other 
Neku,No...
Joshua,No what?
Neku,"Sure, other Players are strangers. Not just Players. Everyone. I don't"
Joshua,"My, my. This isn't like you at all. Well, just don't get your hopes "
Neku,Enjoy the moment.
Joshua,Hmm?
Neku,Enjoying your world means making it bigger. I finally get that. The 
Joshua,...... Hee hee. Maybe so. Only by allowing strangers in can we find 
Neku,Let's go. It's up to us to clear today's mission.
Joshua,Hee hee. Certainly looks that way.
Neku,(For all the other Players... We have to win this!)
Joshua,Looks like Route 5's the only one open.
Neku,Route 5?
Joshua,From the scramble crossing out to Udagawa.
Neku,So that 2.2 number...
Joshua,2.2360679. It's the square root of 5.
Neku,"Ugh, Pi-Face and his lame jokes. So what's the 0 + 5?"
Joshua,"Route 5 spans a total of six areas. The scramble, Center Street, AMX,"
Neku,Udagawa would be 5.
Joshua,Precisely. Problem solved. Our targets are the bosses of the scramble
Neku,"All right. Let's get this mission done. Next stop, Udagawa!"
Joshua,All that remains is the boss of Udagawa.
Neku,Let's move. We're ending this now.
Neku,"!! Them, too!?"
Uzuki,Huff...huff...
Kariya,Still with me?
Uzuki,Where the hell did these Taboo Noise come from?
Kariya,Game Master musta cooked 'em up.
Uzuki,"And sent them out after us Reapers? What is he, crazy!?"
Kariya,"Incoming, Uzuki!"
Joshua,They're having a rough time of it.
Neku,......
Joshua,"Well, Neku? Do we send in the cavalry?"
Neku,Let's do it. They'll hate it.
Joshua,You're so vindictive.
Neku,You guys OK?
Uzuki,"You two... Why'd you help us? Are you, like, stupid? We're your "
Kariya,Whew! You guys saved our butts. We were eight kinds of boned.
Uzuki,What? Kariya!
Kariya,"Enemy or not, if somebody helps you, you say thanks."
Uzuki,"Ugh, whatever. I didn't ask for your help! Just thinking about it "
Kariya,Two simple words. Is it that hard?
Neku,She'd rather have been Noise food?
Joshua,"Maybe ""barf"" is her version of ""thank you."" Let's get moving."
Neku,We can't risk it. Let's run
Joshua,Wise choice.
Uzuki,"This is getting ugly... Kariya, we're pulling out!"
Kariya,"Yes, ma'am!"
Neku,We're here. What's the time?
Joshua,Thirty minutes left.
Neku,Piece of cake. Let's wreck this thing!
Neku,"Mission cleared. (Hang in there, Shiki. One more day...)"
Minamimoto,Heh heh heh... Zetta fun times.
Neku,!? Zetta...
Neku,(Nrrgh! My head... again...)
Joshua,"Hee hee. Why, hello there. Bored again? Or maybe just lonely."
Minamimoto,Can't have you 2 dying on me. My calculations'd go haywire. I'd
Neku,(Glad? Why would he be glad?)
Joshua,Ahh! So you were the mystery helper in the first fight. Thanks for
Minamimoto,Anyone too weak to beat a 000 like that is garbage. CRUNCH!
Neku,(He... helped us?)
Minamimoto,Remember what tomorrow is? Day 7! That magical day when I get to 
Joshua,"Not too fast, I hope."
Minamimoto,"299, 792, 458 m/s!"
Neku,What?
Joshua,The speed of light?
Minamimoto,I'll correct the deviation that saved you last time we met here.
Neku,(The pain's fading... Are he and I connected or something?)
Joshua,Tomorrow won't be fun. I can only imagine what he'll try.
Neku,"(""Last time""? What did he mean by that? Was he talking to Joshua? He "
Konishi,That concludes Yashiro's report.
Megumi,So the Taboo Noise were Minamimoto's doing.
Konishi,"This is grave treason, sir. Allow me to handle Minamimoto."
Megumi,No need. I'll discuss his punishment with the Composer. Your input is
Konishi,"...Understood. However, this is a matter of urgency. I hope you'll"
Megumi,You may. The rules are very clear.
Konishi,"Yes, sir. One closing remark-- A certain Player has exhibited great"
Megumi,"...Heh. Sakuraba, of course! Just when I thought I had Him figured "
Day,Beast on the Prowl. Chapter Closed]
Neku,Day 7...
Joshua,Indeed. Kind of a shame. We never found a way into the Shibuya River.
Neku,...... Joshua... Why'd you kill me?
Joshua,"I killed who, now?"
Neku,"Drop it, Josh. You said it yourself."
Joshua,I just asked what you'd do if I had.
Neku,"Look, did you or--"
Neku,"Rrgh... The mission. When we're through with this, you're telling me"
Joshua,"Hee hee. Whatever you say, Neku."
Neku,"""Game 7: Erase the Game Master at Pork City. time = 600 minutes."
Joshua,......
Neku,What?
Joshua,"This mission seems odd. Ah, well. No sense in worrying about it. "
Neku,That's past Dogenzaka. Let's go.
Joshua,After you.
Neku,Today we put the Grim Heaper to sleep.
Joshua,"He's in Pork City, just past Dogenzaka. Hee hee... How very"
Neku,Durff! A wall...
Joshua,Looks like it's Pork City or nowhere.
Neku,"! Hmm? Another mail? ""P.S. Have cow and mouse on hand."" ""P.S.""? That's "
Joshua,...... This entire mission seems odd.
Neku,Yeah... It is a bit different. No riddles. No weird numbers.
Joshua,......
Neku,Now this all of a sudden... Think it's a trap?
Joshua,Who can say? Though I have my guesses. Hee hee. All we can do is play
Neku,Right.
Joshua,Hmm... Cow and mouse...
Neku,The heck does that mean?
Neku,Cow and mouse? What's that about?
Joshua,"Hee hee. Neku, out of curiosity... do you know what D+B"
Neku,Pfft... Seriously?
Joshua,Another fun trivia tidbit-- Mus Rattus is Latin for rat.
Neku,"So, D+B and Mus Rattus..."
777,Hey! It's you guys! Perfect timing!
Neku,"(Ugh, not more errands... I say we run for it.)"
Neku,Durff! Another wall!?
777,"Hey, c'mon! Don't bail. I wanted to give you this, for your"
Neku,"Uh, thanks. Did you find your microphone?"
777,...... 'Fraid not.
Joshua,I'm sorry to hear that.
777,But it's cool. We've got a new one! We're gonna bust outta the
Neku,They're gonna major with that megaphone?
Joshua,Hee hee. I'd like to see that concert.
Neku,No joke. What the heck kinda music are they making?
Neku,This is where he's hiding?
Joshua,It's a good spot for it.
Neku,How's that?
Joshua,All the stray thoughts in Shibuya flow through here. They hit Pork 
Neku,And he's sitting on top of it all? Smug bastard.
Joshua,Attention seekers do tend to favor high places.
Neku,"That's him all right. (I just need to take him out. Sit tight, Shiki.)"
Reaper,! Players? Here?
Neku,"(Uhh, yeah?)"
Joshua,That's the mission. Erase the Game Master here in Pork City.
Reaper,"...... You hear anything about this, man?"
Reaper,Nope. Mr. Minamimoto told us to guard this spot. That was six
Reaper,...... Well? What do you think?
Reaper,"They're here on a mission, right? Why not do the usual?"
Reaper,"Makes sense... If they're here on a mission, that means"
Reaper,...... Want to get upstairs? You'll have to wipe out all this
Reaper,"This place is a little special, see? Erasing Noise here is"
Reaper,...... Objective met. Floor clear! [Wall goes down]
Neku,Hey... Does fighting here seem odd to you? Why do we wind up in that
Joshua,I don't really know... It could be the imaginary number plane Mr. H
Neku,Imaginary what?
Joshua,A parallel plane a fraction away from the world Noise inhabit. We may
Neku,That Pi-Face's work?
Joshua,Probably. But even so... Pork City is kind of an exception to begin
Neku,Wonderful.
Joshua,Hee hee. This IS his base after all.
Neku,Not for long. Let's head upstairs and beat him down.
Joshua,"Apparently, something about this building restricts the"
Neku,We'll be fine as long as we use the right brand's pins.
Reaper,! Players!?
Reaper,Why are they here?
Neku,(Again?)
Joshua,"We're here for the mission, thanks."
Reaper,...... What mission?

Megumi,You play the Game well. Let me take a moment to congratulate you-- 
Neku,Assist you? I don't think so.
Megumi,"Ah, but did you not rid us of Sho Minamimoto, the rebel?"
Neku,Rebel? He wasn't on your side? Then that last mission--

Neku,You used us! What did you do to Joshua?
Megumi,Joshua is no more.
Neku,No...
Megumi,He took the brunt of Minamimoto's attack. Both boy and lion vanished.
Neku,Then he died... protecting me? Why would he do that?
Megumi,He must have had some affection for you as a partner.

Neku,Keypin?
Beat,"Yeah, the Reapers got 'em to open each area."
Neku,They have keys?
Beat,How you think I opened that last wall?
Neku,"""Open""? I think you mean ""smash."""
Beat,"Openin' them takes too long! We got through, aight? Who cares how!"
Neku,Certainly not you.
Beat,"'Sides, breakin' the walls feels better."
Neku,"This is nuts, dude. Keep it up, and you won't last out the mission!"
Beat,"It don't matter, man. Arrrgh, what the hell! LET ME IN!"
Neku,...... Maybe you've got the wrong key.

Neku,"""Trust your partner."" That's the key to survival here. So I gotta know:"
Beat,Yeah. So?
Neku,Is that the only reason? I can't afford any surprises in this Game. Why
Beat,"What's a ""jeppardy""?"
Neku,Huh?
Beat,"Look, man. I dunno your big words. But I do got another reason."
Neku,OK. What?
Beat,I wanna set Shibuya up widda new Composer. Me!
Megumi,"I'm back, Konishi."
Konishi,Mr. Kitaniji. Have you made a decision?
Megumi,Yes. Strip the little rebel of his Reaperhood. Treat him as a Player
Konishi,"Yes, sir."
Megumi,"I needn't remind you, Konishi, of your obligation to erase both the"
Konishi,"I'll get the job done, sir."
Megumi,"Good. But to be safe, I'm requiring all Reapers to wear their O-Pins."
Konishi,"Outlet Pins? Sir, I know O-Pins enhance Reaper battle performance, "
Megumi,"Nonetheless, the Composer wills it. I, for one, am grateful. Haven't "
Konishi,"Yes, sir."

Beat,Who'zat?
Konishi,"Greetings. I am this week's Game Master, Mitsuki Konishi."
Beat,"Tsk... This is the Iron Maiden? Move, yo! I ain't got time for you!"
Konishi,So primitive. You think I can't see what you're up to? You were 
Beat,"So what, yo!? I'm a Reaper. I don't gotta do some stupid mission!"
Konishi,"...As I thought. Well, I regret to inform you you were officially"
Beat,"Pfft. Whatever. You can't fire me, 'cause I quit, yo!"
Konishi,"Oh, don't act like a child."

Neku,Five days?
Beat,Then I ain't gonna last the Game...
Konishi,The Reapers' wings are not license to do whatever you please. Ponder
Beat,!! What!? NO!
Konishi,"I wonder what you hold dearest. Could it be... this Noise? It is,"
Beat,"Give her back, you Iron Witch!"
Konishi,Hmph. I have a better idea. Since this seems to be distracting 
Beat,"NO! Don't you do it, yo!"
Konishi,There. Much more manageable. Now you can focus on my mission.
Beat,Why you... Gimme that pin!!!
Konishi,"First, your mission. How about... ""Defeat me. You have 6 days."""
Neku,DAYS?
Konishi,Or until you perish. Whichever comes first.
Beat,"Yo, I don't need no six days-- I'm gonna finish this right here an' "
Konishi,A predictably hasty response. ...Let me finish. Keep jumping the gun
Beat,Dammit! That ain't fair...
Konishi,"At this point, I am going to move to a certain place. I will stay in"
Neku,So it's like hide-and-seek.

Uzuki,"Oh, c'mon, live a little! Secret weapons? Unchained power? Sign me up!"
Kariya,Uh-huh. Ever wonder why they keep the chains ON?

Beat,"What, Pinky?"
Neku,Yeah. She just took off. You didn't see her?

VWoS,All right! Let's play. But careful: we're good.
VWoS,Ha ha ha! You've got a ways to go.
Prof,Come back when you're ready.
Neku,Hmph...
VWoS,"Hey, not bad!"
Prof,That was fun. Let's play again sometime!
Makoto,"Boss, how have you been?"
Guy,"Fit as a fiddle, thanks."
Makoto,Sorry you had to see me like this.
Guy,Is that new business not panning out?
Makoto,I just don't have the knack for it. I made this big show about 
Guy,......
Makoto,"Boss, tell me. What am I supposed to do now?"
Guy,"Oh, Makoto..."
Makoto,"Heh, I'm sorry. That's not a very fair question after what I did to"
Guy,"! Now just hold on, Makoto. (Reaper Creeper always yields the"
Beat,"Damn right, pops! He's gonna do it, Phones! Now's our turn to Creep, "
Neku,Hmm... (I dunno... This seems too important to leave up to some game.)
Beat,"Do it, Phones!"
Neku,No. Not this time.
Beat,"Huh? Watchu talkin' about, Phones?"
Neku,He needs to find the words himself.
Beat,But Phones...
Guy,"Gaaah! It's not moving! Please! Creep to me, Reaper!"
Makoto,"Hey, Boss, look... I gotta take off."

Guy,"Makoto! Back then, you had your head stuck so far up in the"
Makoto,Heh... Sounds a lot like me now.
Guy,Not quite. The you I knew first? He didn't need fancy clothes 
Makoto,Boss... 
Guy,I think you need to search back and ask THAT person where you
Makoto,Wow... ...... All this time I've been rushing into things. Maybe I 
Guy,"No, I should be thinking you."
Makoto,Huh? For what? 
Guy,"Nothing, nothing."
Makoto,"Hey, Boss. I gotta get going."
Guy,All right. SHow the world what you've got!
Guy,Heh heh. Who needs some piece of paper? My own answers beat the
Beat,"Damn straight, pops. ...Hey, wait a minute. BWAAAH! Phones, you've "
Neku,"...... About this ""Reaper Creeper"" business... I gotta ask you."
Beat,"What, yo?"
Neku,Is that REALLY today's mission?
Beat,"Yo, I told you--"
Neku,I don't think you remember.
Beat,"I do! Like I said, I Reaper Spurt 4--"
Neku,It's SPORT.
Beat,"Hrrrm... ...... Sorry, Phones. It's been two days since I was a Reaper. "
Neku,"(Um...Two days isn't that long. ) Look, next time just be up-front "
Beat,Man... Why I gotta be like this? I never change.
Neku,......
Beat,"You know Rhyme? She used to say the same stuff-- like a hundred times,"
Rhyme,Beat... I don't trust that pink-haired lady. Why she said doesn't add
Beat,We ain't got time for salt!
Rhyme,"We don't have time for mistakes, either. Slow and steady wins the "
Rhyme,"I'm telling you, Beat. We need to find the golden bat."
Beat,We ain't got time for bats!
Rhyme,"We don't have time for mistakes, either. Haste makes waste!"
Beat,She always had some saying. And she knew to think ahead! But me... I
Neku,......
Beat,"I know I gotta think things through. I really do, man. But I freak out"
Neku,"Brother? Wait, Rhyme's your sister?"
Beat,"What, didn't I mention? Yeah. We from the same family."
Neku,Whoa! (I had no idea.)
Beat,"We came to the UG together, partnered up... and then I... I..."
Neku,"Hey, you didn't do anything!"
Beat,"It's like I killed her, man. You don't know the half of it."
Neku,Beat...
Beat,Why I gotta be so stupid? I thought I could bring Rhyme back by 
Neku,......
Beat,"When Rhyme got erased, Hanekoma gathered up her soul and stored it in a"
Neku,So that's why you took off. But wait! That means--
Beat,"That Noise on my shoulder was Rhyme. Her Noise, which I called outta "
Neku,Whoa...
Beat,"I was lookin' for a way to turn her back to normal, but I didn't find"
Neku,Is that how it works?
Beat,"Yup. And once I'm in charge of Shibuya, I can fix Rhyme. I owe her a"
Neku,......
Beat,"Listen up, Phones, 'cause I'm only gonna say this once."
Neku,What?
Beat,Help me... You gotta help me save her. I ain't that smart. I just crash
Neku,...... Screw you.
Beat,What!?
Neku,Don't be an ass. She's my friend. And you act like I'd mind saving her.
Beat,"Don't sweat it, man! I'll bring you all back to life, soon as I'm in"
Neku,All right.
Beat,"Yo, uh... thanks, Phones."
Neku,"Hey, not necessary. Like Mr. H said: ""Trust your partner."""
Beat,Heh heh! True dat.
Neku,So what's today's REAL mission?
Beat,...... Well...first le's track Pinky down.
Neku,So that Noise was Rhyme...
Beat,Tha's right. So we gotta find that Reaper
Neku,"an' get her back, yo."
Uzuki,"Ugh, what's with you losers!?"
Neku,"!? Hey, is that--"
Uzuki,"Don't you want to win at ALL!? I oughta crush this pin! I swear, if "
Beat,"Huh? Tag? Wait, so Reaper Sport 4--"
Uzuki,"It's ""Tag,"" you dolt! Didn't they teach you anything at all? That's "
Neku,Tag.
Uzuki,Huh?
Neku,You're it.
Uzuki,What!?
Beat,Bwa ha ha! You see how stupid she is? She just walked right up to us
Uzuki,That...that last tag doesn't count! And did you just call me stupid?
Beat,"Yo, you are! I ain't never seen no one suck so bad at tag."
Uzuki,Shut up shut up shut up! You have no right to call anyone stupid!
Beat,"We cleared your mission, Pinky. Now hand over the pin!"
Uzuki,"I...I've got another mission for you! ""Defeat the pissed off Reaper!"""
Neku,"Hey, play fair!"
Uzuki,"I have to win this Game. I don't care what it takes! Now bring it, you"
Beat,"Look out, yo! One more punch and you gone! Hand over the pin an' I "
Uzuki,AAAaaaAAAAAAaaaRRRRRRrrrRRRrrrGGGGgggGGH!!! Take your mercy and shove
Neku,Hey! Enough is--
Uzuki,I WANT MY PROMOTION! I'm not shooting for any Miss Nice awards!
Kariya,"Aw, now girl... "

Kariya,Face the facts. They got you whupped.
Uzuki,"Oh, be quiet! You can underachieve all you want. But I want to move "
Kariya,"Up, up, up, and then what?"
Uzuki,Well... I-I-I--
Kariya,Don't know? Then don't bother. Shooting for nothing sounds crazy to 
Uzuki,Then what about you! Why'd you turn your promotion down?
Kariya,......
Uzuki,"Yeah, I know about it. They were gonna make you an officer. And you"
Kariya,...... Being an officer sucks. Why join the brass and strut around
Uzuki,......
Kariya,"'Sides, if I join the officers, how am I gonna sucker you into buyin'"
Uzuki,...Jerk. ...... Well... I guess I can stay in the audience a bit 
Kariya,"Yeah, girl. Stop and smell those concrete roses. Now then. Sorry to"
Beat,"A Lv. 3 keypin? Yo, you can keep this. Gimme Rhyme!"
Kariya,No can do. I haven't had my fun yet.
Beat,Quit screwin' with us!
Kariya,"Um, villain? Screwin' with you is my job. But you have my word. Beat "
Neku,You swear this time?
Kariya,"On my life. ...Wait, that doesn't work. Anyway, I won't be pulling "
Beat,"Dammit, fine. What's your game?"
Kariya,"You'll love it, Freshmeat. All you have to do... is beat me."

Beat,"Yo, you know when I woke up, this was lyin' next to me."
Neku,"...... Well, thanks for mentioning. What is it? A box? What's inside?"
Beat,"I couldn't get it open, man. I tried smackin' the button on top, but--"
Neku,Are you crazy? What if it was a trap?
Beat,"...... Yo, you show me a button, and I wanna push it. Aight?"
Neku,I think they design traps like this with you in mind.
Beat,"Sh-shut up, yo! Leas' we know the button don't work. Press it an' this"
Neku,Oh yeah?
Box,WRONG! Layout reset.
Neku,Now what does that mean?
Beat,"Hmm? We got mail, yo. ""See you at Towa Records. Key's in the box."" This"
Neku,It's from Kariya. So the keypin is in this box?
Beat,That sneaky bastard. How we supposed to open it?

Beat,"Yeah, they was lyin' all over the place."
Neku,Let's check it out.
Beat,"I'll hang on to the box, yo. You tell me when to push the button, "
Neku,Huh?
Beat,......
Neku,Flowers... Was there an accident here? (Hmm? Why isn't he talking?)
Beat,"'Sup with this piece a' paper, yo?"
Neku,Are these markings supposed to be Noise?
Beat,"This star symbol looks familiar, yo."
Neku,"Yeah, 'cause it's on that box of yours."
Beat,Whoa! You're right.
Neku,Think there's a connection?
Beat,"You see this piece a' paper, man?"
Neku,Figure that mark is a Noise?
Beat,"There's a picture of a moon, too."
Neku,What does it mean?
Beat,"Yo, check this piece a' paper."
Neku,These markings look like Noise.
Beat,"There's a picture of a sun, too."
Neku,What does it mean?
Beat,Ooh! Lemme guess! Is it...push time?
Neku,......
Beat,"Aww, no push?"
Neku,I don't think we have the right answer yet.
Beat,"You sure you aint just scared, man?"
Neku,...... (Talk about projection...)
Beat,"OK... Here goes, yo! Careful when you push it!"
Neku,(...Me?)
Box,WRONG! Layout reset.

Beat,Anotha' box?
Neku,Again?
Beat,"Yo, I call Box Holder! Jus' say when you wanna push the button."
Neku,(...Right.)
Beat,"You see this piece a' paper, man?"
Neku,This mark here must represent Noise.
Beat,"There's a picture of a moon, too."
Neku,Just like our new box.

Neku,(He's actually been... THINKING?)
Beat,"Aight, your turn, Phones. I'll watch the box!"
Neku,......
Beat,"Yo, check this piece a' paper."
Neku,These markings must be Noise.
Beat,"There's a picture of a sun, too."
Neku,Just like our new box.
Beat,Ooh! You solve it?
Neku,......
Beat,"Sure you got it, man?"
Neku,"...... (Help, if you're that worried!)"
Box,CORRECT! Box unlocked.

Beat,...... ......
Neku,"!? Hey, whoa! Tears? Seriously... Who are you and what have you done "
Beat,This is where... where me an' Rhyme died.
Neku,Here?
Beat,"That morning' me an' my folks had it out. Jus' like always, I took off."
Neku,......
Beat,"I jumped in front of her, but... I ain't strong enough to stop a car, "
Neku,"I'm...I'm really sorry, man."
Beat,I killed her. I stole her future... ya know? Rhyme wasn't a loser like 
Neku,"But c'mon, man. You know she didn't hold it against you."
Beat,I'll never know.
Neku,...Huh? But you two got along great!
Beat,"Yeah, she never blamed me."
Neku,See?
Beat,"LISTEN! She... She didn't remember, yo."
Neku,"Like, her memory was gone?"
Beat,"I dunno. But when we woke up in the UG, an' whatchu think she said to "
Neku,So they took her memory... Like they did with me.
Beat,Prob'ly. But she didn't win the Game. So even if I become Composer an'
Neku,That's terrible...
Beat,It's what it is. But I don't care! I'm still gonna bring her back! 
Neku,"I'm with you, man."
Beat,"Thanks. ...... Sorry, I'm wastin' time. We...we gotta get over to Towa"
Beat,"Here goes. Aight, it's open. Le's go, Phones."
Neku,OK.
Beat,Where you at!? Come on out!
Neku,Is he even here?
Beat,"Tsk... Fool's prob'ly hidin' somewhere. Yo, what if we scan for him?"
Neku,You can't scan Reapers.
Beat,"No, but we might find anotha' clue!"
Neku,...... All right.
Beat,"Yo, Phones, hold up! Lollipop said he's here, right? Le's "
Neku,That's odd...
Beat,Huh? Wassup?
Neku,I can't scan!
Beat,"What? That's wack, man! Try again."
Neku,(......) I'm serious! It's not working.
Beat,No way! Why not!?
Neku,(Good question.)
Beat,So this means... what? Everybody's a Reaper?
Neku,"C'mon, please. You see any wings? And if they were Reapers, they'd "
Beat,"Aight... so then what, yo?"
Neku,"! Hey, look! Red Skull pins."
Beat,"Yeah, all the people's got 'em..."
Neku,"Wait! What if it's the pins? Maybe they block my scan, like the Player"
Beat,"Could be, yo. Rhyme said Players can't scan each other."
Neku,Or technically people carrying Player Pins. It's like the pin blocks 
Beat,"So these people is all Players? I mean, if they got pins, yo..."
Neku,"No, we're the only two Players. I'm sure of it. These people are alive-"
Beat,"Naw, they can't play the Game if they alive. THINK, man!"
Neku,We can't all be great thinkers like you.
Beat,"So, yo, the Red Skull pins-- they a CAT design, right?"
Neku,"Wow, you know CAT?"
Beat,"Hells yeah, I ain't stupid. Everybody in Shibuya knows CAT! The two "
Neku,They do.
Beat,"It can't be a coincidence. The same guy musta made both, yo."
Neku,......
Beat,So that means... he's also gotta be... uhhhhhhhhhmmmmmmmm ...meh.
Neku,Riiight. How 'bout we go get Rhyme?
Beat,Oh! Good call! Lollipop is waitin'!
Neku,"...... (...Naw, that's ridiculous. It can't be him...)"
Kariya,"Oh, here already?"

Uzuki,"Ugh, Kariya! You lazy bum. Who said you could call it a day? Now look"
Kariya,Uzuki! What are you doing here?
Uzuki,I came to see if you were goofing off. And it's a good thing. 
Kariya,"Oh, do you have to be such a drudge?"
Uzuki,"Hey, who told me to put my heart into my work? Now you're gonna have "
Beat,"Tha's perfect, yo. We'll take both you and Lollipop at once! How many"
Kariya,"Aight, Uzuki. One more fight. If I have to."
Uzuki,You have to. I'll buy you a bowl of ramen later.

Beat,This pin's a fake!
Neku,"You dirty, lying cheaters!"
Kariya,Damn! I KNEW I couldn't trust her. Hoodwinked again!
Uzuki,"Kariya, what are you talking about?"
Kariya,The Iron Maiden gave us a fake on purpose.
Uzuki,What!? Then where's the real pin?
Kariya,Where do you think?
Uzuki,She lied to us!? Then my promotion... All of it...
Kariya,"Beat, I don't know what to say."
Beat,It's aight. Betchu ain't never even seen the real pin. How would you
Kariya,That's no excuse. I should've seen through the trick. Here. It won't 
Beat,"A Lv. 4 keypin? What's this for, man?"
Kariya,For everything. Right now... the UG needs you two to have this.
Neku,(The UG needs us? Why?)
Beat,"Aight, man. I know what to do."
Neku,(You... you do!?)
Beat,"C'mon, Phones! Oh, yo, 'fore I forget."
Kariya,Hmm?
Beat,Watch your backs.
Kariya,And why would we need to do that?
Neku,The last Reaper to give us a keypin got erased. We think the GM was
Beat,"Dontchu go bein' the next, aight?"
Kariya,"Aight. Thanks for the advice. We can take care of ourselves. Right,"
Uzuki,"Hmph. They can mind their own business. Go on, scram...before I get"
Beat,"Huh? Somethin' happened yesterday? I can't remember a thing! C'mon,"
Neku,Right. We've got a Game Master to find.
Kariya,"...Face it, she just used us to stall for time. Kiss that promotion "
Uzuki,Never.

Neku,We beat the Game Master. But I haven't been taken to that white room.
Beat,Prob'ly 'cause we been breakin' rules left an' right.
Neku,I'm pretty sure the Game is null and void.
Shiki,Null and-- But what about our lives!?
Beat,"There still might be a way, yo-- if I become the next Composer!"
Shiki,How does that work?
Beat,I gotta take down the guy with the job now.
Shiki,Hmm... I see.
Neku,You don't seem surprised.
Shiki,Not really. You both look so serious.
Neku,......
Shiki,So I guess that must be the only way.
Beat,"Don't worry, yo! I'ma pull this thing off!"
Shiki,"I know, Beat. Let's not waste any time, then!"
Neku,(If the Composer stands between me and life... then he has to go. I...I
Shiki,"Neku, let's go!"
Neku,"Yeah, coming..."
Shiki,"The Composer's really strong, right?"
Neku,Yeah. But we still have to do this.
Shiki,I know! Good thing we have each other.
Beat,"You said it, yo. Together we gonna take back our lives."
Neku,C'mon!
Shiki,! Look! There's something there.
Neku,One of Pi-Face's heaps?
Beat,Le's check it out.
Neku,That junk heap...
Shiki,Let's check it out.
Beat,"Yo, Neku! Le's check that garbage heap."
Shiki,Omigosh! There's a person under there!
Beat,"Yo, look who it is!"
Neku,The Grim Heaper got... crunched.
Beat,"No way, man... This guy was tough as bricks! Who coulda done this to "
Neku,I dunno. But whoever it was must have been more powerful.
Beat,"But, like... yo! We lucky, right?"
Shiki,Don't be so morbid!
Beat,But we don't gotta beat him now!
Shiki,No. Just the other guy who's stronger.
Beat,"Details, yo. I'm tellin' ya, we lucky!"
Neku,......
Beat,Now le's keep goin'!
Neku,What happened here?
Neku,(And Pi-Face was so strong...)
Shiki,"We're close, I can feel it. You ready?"
Beat,"The Beat-wagon's always ready, yo!"
Neku,(Talking about it won't get it done.) Let's go!
Shiki,"Whew... This door just screams ""endgame."""
Beat,"We almost there, Rhyme. Hang on jus' a little longer."
Neku,......
Shiki,"Neku, you all right? You look pale."
Neku,....I'll be OK. Come on.
Neku,Is this the Composer's pad?
Beat,Wait... I know this place....
Shiki,Wow...
Neku,What's a ritzy pad like this doing here?
Beat,Yo! We got company!
Megumi,"Welcome, Players. "
Beat,!?
Megumi,"Ex-Players, that is. Your Game has ended. Now you are simply Dead."
Shiki,It's him...
Beat,"Whatchu doin' here, Shades!?"
Neku,Where's the Composer?
Megumi,"Oh, is that why you're here? And why would you kids want to meet the"
Beat,"Whatchu think, man? We gonna take him down!"
Megumi,Not a chance. You're not even fit to look upon Him.
Beat,Whatchu say?
Megumi,The Composer's utmost concern is mankind's happiness. He exists to
Beat,"Yo, I don't get a word you sayin', but you ain't stoppin' me! I'm gonna"
Megumi,You see! That self-serving rubbish is the root of all pain!
Beat,What?
Megumi,Egotism-- disregard for others-- has caused Shibuya's downfall. And 
Shiki,Nngh...
Beat,!?
Shiki,Gahhh!
Neku,Shiki?
Shiki,......
Neku,She's not answering...
Beat,You bastard! What did you do to Shiki?
Neku,Got him!
Megumi,I see now why He picked you... Unnngh...
Beat,"Aight, yo! Composer's next!"
Neku,But Shiki--Nngh!
Beat,Wh-what the hell?
Shiki,......
Beat,Shiki? Damn... She don't recognize us!
Neku,"Why can't she-- (Wait. She has one on, too. If I break it...)"
Beat,"It's no good, man! Girl be tryin' to kills us! We outta options. "
Neku,Stop! Don't you touch her!
Beat,Stupid... Behind you!
Neku,Huff...huff... That should... stop Shiki... I was right. It was the 
Neku,(Where's the Composer? The River ends here. There's no place 
Neku,"This graffiti... (I remember, Mr. H. Your art kept me going. Every "
Neku,(Shiki... Beat... Joshua... Rhyme... Everybody. They got me this far.
Neku,"This place... Come on out, Composer! Fight me! You want me to defeat "
Meg,Who's Mr. H?
Neku,!? You again! But I just beat you!
Megumi,Ha ha ha ha! I'm amazed! Here you stand on the final stage-- and 
Neku,What do you mean...
Megumi,"All right. You want answers? First off, the Composer is not the man "
Neku,......
Megumi,I have been in charge of the UG since his departure.
Neku,Mr. Hanekoma's... not the Composer? Then you're responsible...
Megumi,"For many things, yes."
Neku,Why... Why would you do this to Shibuya?
Megumi,"Oh, Neku... Don't you like music?"
Neku,Huh?
Megumi,"Music requires many things. Melody, performers, instruments... But "
Neku,One ideal?
Megumi,Didn't you feel it in Shibuya? Rage. Hate. Misery. Envy. Fear.
Neku,"""Ills""?"
Megumi,"By tearing down the differences between us, I can make the world a"
Neku,By making everybody think alike? That's not even pos--
Megumi,It IS possible! With these pins.
Neku,"The Red Skull pins. You're behind that, too!?"
Megumi,"I based them on the Composer's Player Pin. You see, the eyes of the"
Neku,Huh?
Megumi,"It neutralizes the effects of the Red Skull pin, so my imprinting "
Neku,"(This pin protects me? All this time, it was...)"
Megumi,What have your dealings with other people brought you? Only hurt.
Neku,......
Megumi,Join me. Help me build a new Shibuya.
Neku,"Not too long ago, I might have agreed. But not now. I've "
Neku,I'll never help you! Maybe living in your Shibuya WOULD be easier. 
Megumi,Then let me ask you this...Do you like people?
Megumi,...I see. Hmph. Why you would is beyond me... I think you need to be
Megumi,...... I see... I think you need to be reformed.
Neku,Rrgh...
Megumi,Save your energy. An unpartnered Player has little to no power. You
Neku,I... I can't move!
Megumi,Remember that I'm saving you. This pin was standing between you and
Neku,DON'T!!!
Megumi,Welcome to the new Shibuya.
Neku,...... ...... Nothing happened!
Megumi,Wh-what!? But I destroyed your Player Pin! Why can't I imprint on 
Neku,"Whose ""pick""?"
Megumi,I owe you no more explanations! Only destruction!
Beat,"Yo yo yo, I don't think so! Ain't you forgettin' somebody? Here comes "
Neku,Huh? Beat! Shiki!
Beat,"I told you, yo. Ain't no one gonna be the Composer but me!"
Shiki,"How could you go on without us, Neku? We're your partners! Now what "
Neku,Um... trust 'em?
Shiki,That's better!
Beat,"Yo, forget this ""partner"" crap. You ain't my partner anymore, man. "
Neku,Beat...
Shiki,"C'mon, Neku. We've still got work to do!"
Neku,Yeah... Mr. Ringleader here...
Beat,"We jus' gotta take out Shades, right?"
Neku,Right.
Shiki,The three of us can do it! Now let's take our lives back!
Neku,Right! Get him!
Megumi,"I'm this close... Once I erase these three, Shibuya will be saved..."
Megumi,No... I must keep fighting... My time is... almost up...
Joshua,"I'm back, Megumi."
Neku,!? J-J-J...
Joshua,Your timer must be nearly ticked out.
Neku,Joshua!? You're alive! But why are you here?
Megumi,"No, Sir! I'm not done, not yet! I WILL protect Shibuya!"
Joshua,Hee hee... It seems I've won.
Megumi,NOOOOOO!!! It can't end like this... Who else will protect Shibuya?
Neku,!? A timer!? Why does HE have a timer?
Megumi,Then... You'll do as You intended?
Megumi,End... Shibuya? But Composer...Sir! Why!?
Joshua,I've decided to wash my hands of it. It has no future value to me or
Megumi,"Wait, Sir! Shibuya is still full of so many possibilities!"
Joshua,"Yes, and people too dull and clouded to see them. Shibuya's influence"
Megumi,Then...the problem is the people? If they changed to something more
Joshua,"Yes, but that's clearly beyond them."
Megumi,Sir...give me a chance to prove You wrong. I swear I'll remake 
Joshua,"...... A Game, then."
Megumi,THE Game?
Joshua,"That's right. The rules will be simple. If you manage to fix Shibuya,"
Megumi,...And if I can't fix it?
Joshua,"Then you lose, Megumi. You and Shibuya will be erased."
Megumi,"...That's all right. If I can risk my life to protect Shibuya, I "
Joshua,"Relax, Megumi. I'll be sure to handicap myself. I'll retreat to the "
Megumi,"Very well, Sir. I'll enter Your Game."
Joshua,"Then first I'll need to collect your entry fee. You have one month,"
Megumi,"You're going to erase it... The streets I know and love, gone..."
Joshua,"You did well, Megumi. That was one of my more enjoyable Games."
Megumi,"I gave it my all, Sir. I have no regrets."
Joshua,"You know, I liked your idea. Shame it didn't work out."
Megumi,"You gave me a wonderful opportunity. Thank You, Sir."
Megumi,"As for you... Well played, Player. I still can't fathom why"
Neku,Me neither... Wait! That's right!
Megumi,Another Player Pin!? Why do you have two? I only gave you 
Neku,Huh? Joshua? What's going on?
Joshua,All of this was a Game-- one set up by me.
Neku,What? Then that means you're--
Joshua,Let me make it obvious. Hmm... I suppose they'll serve.
Shiki,Wh-what's happening?
Beat,I can't... move...yo...
Neku,Shiki? Beat!?
Joshua,"Hee hee... It was me, Neku. I'm Shibuya's Composer."
Neku,What? But that... can't be...
Joshua,I know that must unsettle you. Especially since we spent all that
Neku,Then everything I've one... All of it...
Joshua,"Mm-hmm. You were playing for my team. Really, you did a bang-up job. "
Neku,Then... What have I done!?
Joshua,I had one role in this Game: picking the Player who would play for 
Neku,...Me?
Joshua,"Very sharp, Neku! Give yourself a hand. I knew I picked a winner."
Neku,But it was Pi-Face that killed me...
Joshua,His bullet was meant for me. For some time now he's been after my 
Neku,Then you're the one who beat him?
Joshua,"Why, yes! You're just sharp as a tack, Neku. Anyway, the pest "
Neku,!!Into the RG? Wait... No!
Joshua,Hee hee. Why don't I return all the memories I've been holding on to?
Neku,Nyaaagh!!!
Minamimoto,I blew it...
Neku,What!?
Neku,Huff...huff... It was you! ...... I thought... I thought I finally 
Joshua,"Hee hee. Now, Neku, why don't we play one last Game?"
Neku,You tricked me...
Joshua,"The winner gets to be the Composer, and do whatever he likes with"
Neku,You're a monster...
Joshua,"Neku? You'd better pick up that gun. I mean, this IS going to be a"
Neku,"Don't screw with me, Joshua!"
Joshua,"I assure you, I'm not. Life's little crossroads are often as simple "
Neku,......
Joshua,"Neku... Hee hee, your face is priceless. Don't you remember what Mr."
Neku,I'm just...
Joshua,"Oh, before I forget! I've collected your entry fee. Now... Let the "
Neku,Why... WHAT THE HELL!?
Neku,"Same streets...Same crowds too. Yeah, Shibuya hasn't changed a bit. But"
Shiki,Let me in! Tell me what you're thinking!
Joshua,Only by allowing strangers in can we find new ways to be ourselves.
Shiki,I'm scared! Scared of getting a second chance...
Beat,"Listen up, Phones. Cuz I ain't askin' twice. Please, help me. You gotta"
Shiki,"Neku, that's the first time you used my name."
Joshua,"But Neku, I thought you couldn't afford to lose. Give up on yourself,"
Beat,"You ain't my partner anymore, man; you're... my friend."
Shiki,Once you see the real me... will we still be friends?
Neku,"I'm glad I met you guys. You made me... pick up on things, I probably"
Beat,Yo!
Rhyme,Over here!
H,"You know... This mess is gonna have repercussions upstairs. But hey,"
H,Some folks just don't take no for an answer.
Neku,"(Same station. Same crowds, too. Same noises. Same buildings zigzagging"
Neku,"Dang, lookit this crowd..."
Higashizawa,Yoo-hoo ? Registration's right this waaay!
Neku,"Wow, listen! They even hired a booth babe!"
Higashizawa,"Better hustle, though! The slam-off starts soon!"
Neku,"Yeek! (Holy crap, it's a dude! With... wings!?)"
Higashizawa,"C'mon, now. Dilly-dally, shilly-shally ?"
Neku,"(Dilly... what? What the heck does that mean? And more importantly, who"
Shooter,Move it! Comin' through! 
Neku,Hmm? Gah!
Shooter,"HOLY OWW! Sorry, man! I'm in a hurry! "
Neku,"(Geez, slow down, twerp.) This place is packed, kid. You shouldn't be"
Shooter,I had to! I can't miss registration! I've been training for WEEKS 
Neku,"Training, huh... (You mean wasting your time.)"
Shooter,Are you gonna enter too?
Neku,"Well, yeah."
Shooter,SWEET! Good luck! Stay in the game long enough and you might get to
Neku,Wha- (Who does this kid think he is?)
Shooter,"Oh, snap! The TIME! See ya, man!"
Neku,(That half-pint talks a big game. ...Weird. Where have I seen him? )
Guy,"Nice turnout... Having fun, kid?"
Neku,"Huh? Oh, uh, yeah. Surprised at all the people, though. Tin Pin really"
Guy,"Yeah, it's great! I knew they were the ones for the job."
Neku,"(... They, who?)"
Guy,"You a player, too? What do you think? My company's sponsoring "
Neku,"I'm impressed by how orderly it all is, considering the turnout."
Guy,"Good, good. We hired a separate company to plan and run the"
Neku,"Guess the sponsor can't do it all, huh?"
Guy,"Goodness, no! The bigger the event, the more folks it takes to"
Neku,Wow. I guess pulling something like this off takes all kinds of 
Higashizawa,"Well, hiya ? Here to register, kiddo? I can still squeeze you "
Neku,Sign me up.
Higashizawa,"OK, let me just jot down your info. There we are ? Now, just"
Neku,Uh... 'K.
Higashizawa,Enjoooy ?
Announcer,Attention all players... Please report to your designated blocks.
Neku,"(First up, the prelims! This should be easy. Just focus on the game,"
Neku,No! I lost... It's... It's all over. I'm through.
Guy,"Hey, emo kid!"
Neku,H-huh?
Guy,"Don't let one little loss get you down! Here, I'll "
Neku,"Pull a... Whoa, seriously? Is that cool?"
Guy,Ha ha ha! I'm the sponsor. It's my party! Consider it
Neku,(I dunno... Seems kinda unfair...)
Guy,Hey. This kid's back in. Set him up with a new
Higashizawa,"Right away, Boss ?"
Neku,"One down! Man, I love this game! OK, round two... Game on!"
Neku,Yesss! (That should weed out most of the noobs... Everybody left has
Higashizawa,Wooo ? The time has finally come... for the Shibuya Tin Pin
Kariya,"Thank you, thank you. Shibuya's at the top of Japan's slamming "
Higashizawa,"... And I'm your MC, Yodai Higashizawa!"
Kariya,"All right, Yodai, let's hear about our finalists."
Higashizawa,Absolutely ? Entry #5... Megumi Kitaniji!
Kariya,"Look at that poker face, Yodai. Clearly he's big on plaing mind "

Neku,(Don't sound so surprised. I'm gonna be the man to break you.)
Announcer,"There you have it, folks! One of these four finalists will go home"
Neku,(Every slammer's dream pin. Gimme gimme!)
Higashizawa,"Okey doke ? Now then... Cough up those pins, suckers."
Neku,Huh!?
Uzuki,"Mwa ha ha! Nice work, boys!"
Neku,Is this part of the program!? 
Neku,What the- Not my phones! HANDS OFF THE PHONES! 
Someone,HEY!
Someone,Get your-
Someone,Watch the hands!
Neku,Whew... Guess I kinda freaked there.
Someone,My pins! Somebody stole all my pins! 
Neku,What!? They were stolen!?
Someone,"Mine, too!"
Someone,Somebody grab 'em!
Megumi,Damn... I was careless.
Joshua,"They got me, too."
Shooter,Give them BACK!
Uzuki,"Thanks for the pins, people!"
Kariya,We appreciate you bringing 'em all to one place.
Shooter,What are you talking about!?
Higashizawa,The fastest way to gather a vast number of pins is to have them
Uzuki,"Zip it, Yodai! Enough rhyming and unnecessary exposition."
Higashizawa,"Sorry, ma'am!"
Shooter,"Give me back my pins, NOW! "
Uzuki,"No can do, shorty. We're gathering them for a reason. We need them "
Shooter,Who are you!?
Higashizawa,"The Black Skullers! We're Tin Pin cullers, bent on purifying-"
Uzuki,"Rhyming, Yodai. Exposition."
Higashizawa,"Sorry, ma'am."
Uzuki,"We're done here, boys!"
Neku,So they're pin thieves!? ... Wait a sec. (I still have all mine. Guess 
Announcer,"Please remain calm. Due to mass pin thievery, we regret to"
Neku,"(Guess they have no choice. Well, time to head home...)"
Shooter,"HEY, BRO! They took your pins too, right!? "
Neku,"Uhh... Y-yeah... Darn them. (If folks knew my pins were spared, I might"
Shooter,There's only one thing left to do!
Neku,What?
Shooter,Join me in taking back our SOULS!
Neku,Our... what?
Shooter,"Well, DUH. Our pins! Pins are every slammer's soul, bro."
Neku,(Oh. The pins.)
Shooter,"Now, rise up and fight! The time is nigh to join hands and take back"
Neku,Or to call the cops like a normal person...
Shooter,Meet us at the ramen shop in Dogenzaka!
Neku,We're getting ramen?
Shooter,That's our secret base!
Neku,You have a secret ramen base?
Shooter,Go tell Doc there what happened!
Neku,There's a ramen doctor at your secret ramen base?
Shooter,"Yuh-huh! Dr. Pin! He's AWESOME. Thanks, bro!"
Neku,"Wait, why me!? "
Shooter,FEAR NOT! I'll be right behind you!
Neku,The kid is completely mental... (A secret ramen base? Dr. Pin? I should
Neku,(This must be the place.)
Doi,Irrasshai! What'll it be? We have a limited time special right now--
Neku,"(Stardust? What does that taste like...) I, um... I'm looking for Dr."
Ken,... What? Where did you hear that name? 
Neku,Huh!?
Shooter,MISS ME?
Ken,Irrashai! Come on in.
Neku,(Coulda sworn this guy changed channels on me for a second...)
Ken,"Oh! Back again, kid? "
Shooter,"Hello, mister! Oh, hey, bro. Been waiting long?"
Neku,"Er, no... I just got here a few-"
Shooter,So BRO! Guess who I found. Kindred Spirits in our fight against (dun
Neku,Kindred... what?
Shooter,"Fall in, Spirits!"
Joshua,"Oh, so you're one of us? My, my. Those Black Skullers are in for it"
Shiki,Wow... What a totally cool secret base! But I was expecting more 
Beat,"Yo, is it true they sell curry here? A secret base ain't nothin' "
Ken,This is a ramen shop! Not a curry shop. And not a secret base!
Shooter,"OK, everybody! Eyes on me! Divided we were no better than Pinpricks."
Neku,Red... Spirit? 
Beat,"I'm Daisukeno- aw, screw it. Jus' call me Beat. Hey, Red, where's the"
Neku,"(What, are we all calling him ""Red"" now?"
Shooter,"Stop your tummy-rumbling, Yellow. We're still doing intro-ductions!"
Neku,Yellow!?
Beat,"Sorry, Red. I just love me some food!"
Neku,"(Yellow, Red... Are we reading off the crayon box?)"
Shiki,"My name's Shiki Misaki. I've never been a Spirit before, and I was a"
Neku,(But here you are. A Crayon Warrior.)
Shiki,I can't stay out too late. I have a curfew. But this should be fun! 
Shooter,"Yeah! Don't worry, we'll finish up in no time, Pink!"
Joshua,"No no no, I call Pink. The name is Yoshiya Kiryu. I should be Pink,"
Neku,(Now they're fighting over colors! Who cares... This kid's the craziest
Shiki,"Well, I don't care which color you make me. I can make any hue look"
Joshua,Then be Green.
Shiki,Green? WHy? 
Joshua,Hee hee... The color of your skirt.
Shiki,Oh! Duh... See? I'm already making my color look good.
Joshua,"You know, actually... I should be Gold. The color of wisdom."
Neku,"(First he steals her color, and now he complains? Where did Red... I"
Shooter,Blue. You're up.
Neku,B-Blue? You don't mean-
Shooter,Yup! Blue is you!
Neku,You're joking.
Joshua,Hold on just a second. His shade of blue strikes me as more of a...
Shooter,"Ooh, yeah! I like that!"
Neku,"What do I look like, a bruise!?"
Shooter,"OK, Black 'n' Blue. Introduce yourself!"
Neku,Um... OK. I'm Neku-
Joshua,"No, use your codename! "
Neku,But-
Shooter,"Yeah, good call!"
Neku,Quit ganging up on me!
Shooter,"And now, last but not least- our powerful ally, Dr. Pin!"
Sho,Silence! You wanna eat asphalt? Stupid hectopascal.
Neku,You're Dr. Pin?
Sho,"Well, aint this sweet... Looking' at you zetta twerps makes me wanna--"
Neku,"(Ahhh! Bad man! Mustnt make eye contact... Ohh, please don't hurt me!)"
Sho,--join in on the fun!
Neku,Huh? Join in the fun!
Sho,"Attention, you ramen-raiding radians!"
Neku,Gulp... 
Sho,I insist you make me a Spirit!
Neku,Why would you want to be a CRAYON?
Joshua,"So you're Dr. Pin? I've heard all about you. It's an honor, sir."
Sho,Aww... Zetta shucks.
Neku,(Is he... blushing? It makes him scarier...)
Sho,So what bring you all here?
Shooter,"Well, you see-"
Sho,Wow... That zettabytes. 
Shooter,We want to get out pins back. What do you recommend?
Sho,"Some Old Horses Can Always Hear Their Owner Approach. Listen up, kid..."
Shooter,"But, Doc... We don't even know where the Skullers are... How can we"
Sho,Lure them out.
Shooter,Lure them? With what?
Sho,......
Joshua,"He's eyeing you, Black 'n' Blue. "
Neku,"Who, me? He's looking at me? (What'd I do?)"
Shooter,"What's up, Doc?"
Sho,You zetta morons! You haven't noticed? He's had them the whooole time...
Shooter,Gasp! Had what?
Sho,Pins!
Shooter,What? Really!?
Joshua,"Just as I'd suspected. You're a dastardly one, Brown 'n' Blue."
Neku,Now I'm BROWN!?
Beat,"Yo, hook me up with some more curry!"
Shooter,Black 'n' Blue... You lied to us? 
Neku,No! I just couldn't find the right moment to tell you!
Shooter,"Oh, Black 'n' Blue. You're like a bruise on the tomato of my heart. "
Sho,"Go easy on him, Red. He's the key variable in your victory equation."
Shooter,Our victory equation?
Sho,Black 'n' Blue is your bait!
Neku,"Wait, what!? "
Sho,The Skullers are hunting for pins.
Joshua,Once they know you have some... They'll come to us.
Sho,"Very good. A+ for you. Hit the streets, radians. Play Tin Pin like "
Shooter,OK! Let's get to it!
Joshua,"""Winning like crazy"" may prove a challenge."
Sho,No worries. Just use this. It's one of my originals.
Shooter,A Dr. Pin pin!? Awesome! We're gonna clean up wth this!
Ken,That pin's a dud!
Sho,Whaaat?
Ken,"It hits hard, but only once. Then... CRUNCH! Try it and see."
Shooter,Whoa! No joke...
Joshua,Scrapped on its second slam...
Ken,You never did make much of a pin fiddler. Give it up already.
Sho,... Hectopascal. I'm so better than you... I'm the best pin fiddler 
Joshua,He sized up that pin with one glance... That ramen guy knows pins.
Ken,......
Beat,"This is hella tasty, pops! Hit me with another bowl a' curry ramen, yo."
Ken,"Oh, sorry! We're fresh out. Go play with your friends. I'll whip up some"
Beat,"Bwaaah! No more curry? Aight, guess we be slammin', then."
Neku,(This is all so very weird...)
Shooter,HEY! Play me in Tin Pin! 
Rhyme,Um... Sorry. I can't play right now.
Beat,"She hates Tin Pin, yo."
Shooter,"Friend of yours, Yellow? "
Beat,Yeah... Sorta.
Rhyme,"No, I love Tin Pin."
Beat,What? Since when? 
Rhyme,"I'd play you, but somebody took my pins."
Joshua,Another victim of the great Molco slam-off heist?
Rhyme,"Hmm? No, I guy with a lollipop just ran by and nabbed them all. My "
Joshua,"Oh, you poor thing.."
Shooter,"Don't be down! We'll fix everything! We're Kindred Spirits, fighting"
Rhyme,"Wow. Can I help? I'm Rhyme, by the way."
Joshua,A new Spirit means a new color. 
Neku,(Here it comes...)
Joshua,"Black 'n' Blue, you're demoted to just Blue."
Neku,"(Whatever, I'd rather be normal Blue anywa-- Ugh. I'm turning into one "
Joshua,And you can be Black now.
Rhyme,Excuse me? 
Neku,Just ignore him.
Shooter,YEAH! Black joins the party!
Higashizawa,Freeze.
Shooter,!?
Higashizawa,Nice pins.
Higashizawa,You've sure got a bunch of 'em. Did you gather them all up just
Rhyme,I want my pins back!
Joshua,Hee hee.
Neku,"(You tell him, Giggles...)"
Shooter,It's time to take back our SOULS!
Neku,He... he's good!
Higashizawa,Heh. You don't stand a chance. Now let's have those
Neku,I can't let it end like this! A rematch! I demand a rematch!
Higashizawa,"Heh, you're wasting your time..."
Neku,One more time! 
Higashizawa,Heh heh. As many as you like.
Higashizawa,"Nngh... So, you can slam."
Kariya,"Welcome to today's turning point, folks."
Higashizawa,Kariya...
Shooter,!?
Kariya,Looks like I made it.
Beat,"Heh, just in time to get your ass whupped. We takin' the both a' you"
Kariya,Actually I'm not here for the whup thing. I'm here for a pickup.
Shooter,What!?
Rhyme,"Sorry, Red. I'm just gonna borrow this."
Shooter,Wha-- Black!? Gimme back Red Kaiser! 
Rhyme,"You can't slam without it, can you?"
Shooter,N-NOOO!!! Black! HOW COULD YOU!? I thought we were friends! Kindred
Rhyme,Friends? I'm a Black Skuller.
Beat,"Rhyme, you... No way."
Rhyme,"Yup, I was a spy. Just trying to wear you down, you know?"
Beat,Rhyme...
Joshua,Hee hee... I knew it.
Neku,You did?
Joshua,"She said it was Lollipop that stole her pins, but she asked Steroids"
Neku,(Is it true steroids can shrink your... Never mind.) Yeah... She wasn't
Rhyme,"That's right! Still waters run deep. I knew you were the sharp one,"
Beat,"Rhyme, why?"
Neku,"Uhh, more importantly... you could have told us this earlier."
Joshua,I really don't see how this is my fault. You're the one who refuses 
Neku,So it's MY fault!? 
Shooter,WAAAH! My... my poor Red Kaiser...
Beat,"Wait, Rhyme! Why are you mixed up with those guys? "
Rhyme,"You still don't get it, Beat."
Beat,Get what!?
Shooter,Red Kaiser...
Shiki,"Pull it together, Red."
Shooter,What'll I do... How will I live? 
Neku,"It's, uh... It's just a toy."
Joshua,It's too dangerous to wander around with out leader out of 
Neku,"You DO know you can still play without that thing, right? "
Beat,"C'mon, yo, back to base. Curry's prob'ly ready now."
Neku,(Always the team player.)
Ken,"Irassha-- oh, it's you kids. How goes?"
Shooter,"Hey, mister... Is Dr. Pin here? "
Ken,"What, you want Junior? Hey, why the long face? "
Shooter,Uh... this.
Ken,Holy smashed Kaisers! 
Shooter,I'm gonna get Dr. Pin to fix it! Then we're-
Ken,He can't.
Shooter,What!? 
Ken,This is beyond Junior's ability. ... It's even beyond mine. 
Joshua,"All right, sir. It's about time you told us the truth."
Beat,"You trippin', Pinky? Brotha ain't a liar. Brotha's a ramen man. A ramen"
Joshua,He knows too much about Tin Pin. He can size up any pin at a 
Ken,Yes! All right. You got me. I... I created Tin Pin.
Neku,You invented Tin Pin!? And now you invent weird ramen!?
Ken,"Yes! And as the father of Tin Pin, I can't bear to see it used for evil."
Shooter,"Mister... I'll do it! I lost Red Kaiser, but... but not my love for"
Ken,"Thanks, son. I knew I could count on you kids."
Shooter,... I'll get by somehow. It's not like Red Kaiser really did 
Neku,Nothing!? 
Shooter,It was like a lucky jock... Bracing! 
Neku,Eww! 
Ken,Lucky charms do help give you confidence. So take mine. You need them 
Shooter,WHOA! These are... 
Ken,"Color prototypes for the (new) Solid Slammers! They never hit shelves, "
Neku,"Kids, plural? You want me to wear that thing!? "
Joshua,Dibs on the rainbow. 
Ken,Of course. It was meant for you. 
Shooter,"OK, Pink is now Rainbow! "
Joshua,Ahh! Just look at this handiwork! 
Shiki,"Yeah, they're actually pretty hip. "
Beat,"Whoa! Just havin' it on makes me feel badass, yo!"
Joshua,These prototypes must have cost a fortune... I can see why they were
Shooter,"Try yours on, Blue!"
Neku,This isn't happening...
Joshua,Surely you wouldn't snub this man's generosity. Only a monster would 
Neku,"(Freakin' Rainbow...) ...Fine. That still leaves the black one, though."
Beat,Rhyme... 
Joshua,Black was a spy. We'll leave it here.
Beat,No! I'll carry it. 
Shiki,Beat? 
Beat,"Rhyme ain't... She ain't a bad person. They musta forced her, yo."
Joshua,"...... Whatever keeps you happy, Yellow. Blue already has the emo"
Shooter,"Thanks, mister! No... Dr. Pin, Sr.! I swear I'll get those pins "
Ken,"I'm sure you will, young man. Their hideout is Miyashita Park."
Neku,...... ...... ...... (How do you hide out in a park?)
Shooter,"The jig is up, Black Skullers! We're taking back our PINS! "
Higashizawa,Rrgh... How did you find us? 
Uzuki,"Spicy little thing, aren't ya? Bad timing, though. We were just "
Beat,This smell... It's curry!
Rhyme,Mr. Higgy is our private chef. 
Beat,"M... maybe just one bite... NO! Stay strong, Beat! "
Kariya,"Nice Tin Pin launchers... I see you've got some connections. Gee, I"
Beat,"Snap out of it, Rhyme! It ain't never too late to come back, yo! "
Rhyme,......
Beat,Wha-- Rhyme! 
Kariya,"She's here because she wants to be, man. "
Beat,Dammit! The evil's already got a hold a' her!
Shooter,"Alright, villains! Get ready for a SLAMMIN'!"
Higashizawa,Such fire! I see now why he picked you... 
Shooter,That's RIGHT! We're the Kindred Spirits! 
Uzuki,Hmph... You talk big. Let's see if you can back it up. How 'bout we 
Shooter,"And once we win, you give back the pins you stole! "
Uzuki,Deal.
Higashizawa,We'll play five matches. Anytime you're ready. HA HA HA! ... Ha.
Joshua,Leave round one to Rainbow. Who am I up against?
Guy,Me. Tutorial Guy.
Joshua,... Excuse me? I'm up against an un-named character? What a waste.
Guy,Like a bolt from the blue-
Joshua,What!?
Guy,"... It's, uh, just an expression."
Joshua,Wait... Those glasses! What are you doing here?
Joshua,Nngh... I knew it.
Guy,......
Joshua,Again!
Guy,Best of luck.
Guy,I give. I give.
Joshua,... You were holding back.
Guy,Not at all. Pracice makes perfect. Keep at it.
Joshua,I didn't win this match... He threw it. 
Neku,(What's the deal?)
Joshua,"Tin Pin, yours is truly a mysterious world. I can't believe HE'S"
Neku,(What's he grumbling about? He won.)
Beat,I'm up. Who's gonna bring it?
Rhyme,"Me, silly."
Beat,"... Why you doin' this, Rhyme? This ain't you!"
Rhyme,All you ever do is play Tin Pin. I got tired of nagging you to 
Beat,... That's wha this is about? Our stand-up routine?
Rhyme,I figured I'd just get rid of Tin Pin.
Beat,"What do I gotta practice for, yo? People laugh at me anyway!"
Rhyme,"That's not what this is about, Beat. You don't get it."
Beat,Damn straight I don't! Le's settle this wid Tin Pin!
Beat,Rrgh... I ain't givin' up!
Rhyme,Beat... It's pointless to keep trying.
Beat,Rrgh... 
Beat,I won! Booyaka!
Rhyme,"Great game, Beat. "
Beat,"Right? Victory's my middle name, yo. So c'mon, let's get back together."
Rhyme,You want to pair up again? You're the one who called it off.
Neku,"(Wait, Beat gave HER the boot?)"
Beat,"You got me all mad, yo... Stuff you said was seriously harsh, yo."
Rhyme,"Face it, Beat. People don't laugh at your jokes. They laugh at you."
Beat,"Who cares, so long as they laughin'? I know I'm an idiot... I can't "
Rhyme,You can! You could make stand-up history! I know it. That's why I 
Neku,"(Well, they've got their issues, but Rhyme doesn't seem like a bad"
Shiki,I'm next.
Higashizawa,"The pleasure is mine, young lady."
Uzuki,Hold it!
Shiki,Wh-what!? 
Uzuki,Let me have her.
Higashizawa,"But, boss... The boss is always supposed to go last. "
Uzuki,Quit your whining! I've got a score to settle with this one.
Shiki,Yeah. Let's finish this!
Higashizawa,"Y-yes, ma'am... Show here who's in charge..."
Neku,(These two know each other? What have they got against each other?)
Shiki,Nnnrrraaah!
Uzuki,Hrraaaaaah!
Neku,(Geez! They're wigging out! What the heck is their deal?)
Shiki,The real Prince fans are the-
Neku,What? 
Uzuki,The Black Diablos!
Shiki,Wrong! The White Angels! 
Uzuki,As top minion for the Black Diablos... I'm gonna pitchfork your face! 
Shiki,"Well, as head seraph for the White Angels... I'M gonna bless your head"
Uzuki,Ha ha ha! You thought you could win?
Shiki,Nngh... I can't let her clip my wings!
Shiki,This isn't over! Prepare to be blessed!
Uzuki,Hmph! Take your halo and shove it!
Shiki,Blessed!
Uzuki,This... isn't... happening! The top minion never loses! 
Shiki,"Ex-top minion. As of today, there ARE no Black Diablos."
Uzuki,Hmph... Fine.
Shiki,"Don't worry, we'll let your girls into the Angels."
Uzuki,... Thanks.
Shiki,"I mean, we're all Prince fans, right? You're welcome to join, too."
Uzuki,Pfft. The Prince is so yesterday. I'm into the indie scene now! I'll 
Shiki,"Wait, indies!? Like who?"
Uzuki,777. 
Shiki,"Ahh! I'm totally into him, too! "
Uzuki,WHAAAT!? You plan on getting in my way AGAIN!?
Shiki,I liked him first!
Uzuki,Hrraaaaaah!
Shiki,Nnnrrraaah!
Neku,"(So much for that truce. With that much in common, you'd think they'd "
Kariya,"So, you're taking me on?"
Neku,......
Kariya,"You awake, kid?"
Neku,"I was just thinking... Why are we here, fighting like this?"
Kariya,"A deep question, Blue. But worryin' won't get you anywhere. Life"
Neku,"Yeah, it sure feels that way. There's a force at play that I can't"
Kariya,Just go with the flow. Too much work tryin' to fight it.
Neku,"Sometimes I just feel so... emo. There, I said it."
Kariya,How 'bout some ramen? Take your mind off things.
Neku,... Wait. Are you trying to buy me off with noodles? 
Kariya,"Busted, huh? Aight... If we have to do this the hard way..."
Neku,(Nngh... He's good!)
Kariya,"What, that all ya got?"
Neku,One more round!
Kariya,Aight... Sock it to me.
Neku,Served! 
Kariya,"Aww, look. I lost. Still feeling emo? "
Neku,Now that you mention it... no...
Kariya,"Congrats, kid."
Neku,How come I feel better?
Kariya,Sure you don't already know the answer?
Neku,Hmm... (Maybe I was just looking for something to care about.)
Shooter,NOW! It's my turn! Let's go!
Higashizawa,"Say your prayers, little boy."
Uzuki,"Don't screw this up, Yodai... or else! "
Higashizawa,"Oh, I'd never hand my precious pins over to them... or to you!"
Uzuki,Wh-what!?
Higashizawa,They're all mine! 
Uzuki,"Are you crazy!? We were going to sell those online! At a huge premium,"
Higashizawa,I was never with you Skullers to begin with. Your company was a
Shooter,"Oh, zing!"
Uzuki,Who... who ARE you?
Higashizawa,The TRUE father of Tin Pin!
Joshua,Of course! There was a Y.H. on the original team!
Shooter,So he used to work with the ramen guy?
Higashizawa,The owner of the ramen shop was my supervisor. But my love for 
Joshua,"I heard he was obsessed, even from the onset... His love for the game"
Neku,(So... basically he's just a big geek?)
Shooter,If you really loved Tin Pin... You'd never do this! 
Higashizawa,I love it more than you could ever know! The pins out today are
Shooter,You're wrong! It's not the maker that fills a pin with love! It's 
Higashizawa,Feh. Childish. I will show you the shallowness of your LOVE!
Shooter,No! NOOO!
Higashizawa,Pathetic.
Shooter,Rrgh...
Shooter,I'm not through yet! Not until you see the truth!
Higashizawa,Truth? The truth is that you cannot win.
Shooter,Wuh-oh! (New) Red Kaiser can't take much more! 
Higashizawa,Bwa ha ha! Of course not. Why do you think the (new) Solid
Shooter,I... I dunno...
Higashizawa,They say it was budget cuts and personal heartbreak... What they
Shooter,What!?
Higashizawa,"My supervisor on the project-- he, too, was a victim of"
Shooter,"Dr. Pin, Sr.?"
Higashizawa,His passion was commendable. The company never had much faith in
Neku,(Who knew the ramen guy had so much backstory? )
Shooter,Wow... He must have faced a lot of hard choices.
Neku,(Yeah... Not many fifth graders would get that.)
Shooter,Like... which color he should cancel first... or whether he should
Neku,"(Not many fifth graders... including you, apparently.)"
Higashizawa,"Tin Pin lost its light that day. Money-hungry fools swarmed in,"
Ken,"Stop it, Higashizawa!"
Higashizawa,Boss...
Ken,I'm happy with my ramen shop. I don't regret leaving Tin Pin. And the
Higashizawa,And it will be! Once I finish purifying--
Minamimoto,That's zetta idiotic! Think you're some comic book hero? 
Ken,"Junior, why are you here? "
Shooter,Dr. Pin!? What happened to you? You look TERRIBLE!
Minamimoto,"Sorry to keep you, Red! It took a while, but I've done it! The"
Shooter,The Omega Slammer!? SWEET!
Neku,"(What, did he get caught up in a lab explosion?)"
Minamimoto,"Attention, you Tin Pin-loving vectors! Pound that inverse idiot"
Higashizawa,Heh... Absurd. You actually think that will help you?
Shoooter,YES! Now get ready to hand over all our pins!
Higashizawa,Ridiculous. Did you really believe you could stop me?
Shooter,YES! I... I mean... EVENTUALLY!
Higashizawa,Heh... Absurd. You actually think that will help you?
Shoooter,YES! Now get ready to hand over all our pins!
Shooter,I... I WON!
Higashizawa,"Astounding... The Red Spirit, and the Solid Slammer Omega... You"
Minamimoto,Not entirely. We sitll need you and Pop's help.
Higashizawa,But... I'm no longer worthy to slam...
Minamimoto,"FOIL! First, Outer, Inner, Last! I just built off Pop's last"
Ken,You put it together from that half-baked sketch? Here I thought you were
Minamimoto,"Hey, I love Tin Pin just as much as ram-crotch over here."
Higashizawa,"... Except along the way, my love turned to hate. Thank you for"
Shooter,"Thanks, mister! Let's slam again soon, OK? I've never seen such hard"
Higashizawa,Red...
Uzuki,"Ugh, honestly... You should've told us how you felt. "
Higashizawa,"Sorry, boss... "
Uzuki,"Ha ha, I'm nobody's boss anymore. Now I'm just another 777 stalker."
Shiki,As if. 777 belongs to me and the White Maidens! 
Uzuki,Hrraaaaaah!
Shiki,Nnnrrraaah! 
Kariya,"Anyway, I guess this is happily ever after. Now, how 'bout we "
Beat,"Ramen? Naw, yo. It takes curry flavor to curry my favor!"
Rhyme,"Ha ha ha! There, Beat, see? That was funny!"
Beat,Rhyme... I... I think I understand.
Rhyme,"Welcome to the world of intentional comedy. Hey, Mr. Higgy. Can you "
Beat,Did you say CURRY!? 
Rhyme,"He cooks like a pro. Please, Mr. Higgy?"
Beat,"Rhyme... You really do love me... But yo, we need a kitchen."
Ken,You can use my place.
Higashizawa,Boss... You don't mind? 
Ken,Don't be silly.
Minamimoto,It's zetta cool. Use our shop. It's also a fine spot for Tin Pin
Ken,"Yeah, our secret base! Gya ha ha!"
Neku,(Tin Pin Slammer's won over all these people... Who came up with such a
Shooter,"C'mon, Blue! Let's head back to Molco! "
Neku,"Hmm? Oh, OK."
Guy,"Another town, another band of Kindred Spirits. That takes care "
Shooter,"Wow, it's so empty here! "
Neku,"Yeah, it was packed before."
Shiki,Another party's ended... It's kinda sad.
Joshua,"But isn't that always the case? Endings are sudden, often cruel. You"
Neku,(Today was incredibly weird... but I had a lot of fun.)
Shooter,"Hey, Blue!"
Neku,Hmm?
Shooter,"Let's play Tin Pin! We never got to throw down at Molco, but I knew"
Joshua,"Red and Blue, eternal rivals... It was unavoidable."
Neku,You really are all crazy. ... But I was looking for a chance to take 
Shooter,"Ready, Red?"
Neku,I'm ready.
Shooter,Then let's SLAM!
Neku,Rrgh!
Shooter,You were close! I'll meet you at Molco any time you wanna
Neku,"(It's weird... I lost, but I still feel good. Oh, Tin Pin. "
Neku,......
Shooter,......
Neku,I won... I beat the Shibuya champ! 
Shooter,"You know what that means, Blue... The title's yours!"
Neku,"Eh, this wasn't an official match. I'll see you at next year's slam-"
Neku,"(I feel so much better! Take that, emo urges! I didn't need anything"
Joshua,There you are. I've been looking for you.
Wizard,"And I, waiting for you. "
Neku,Who's he?
Wizard,"I'll give you a hint: ""Like a bolt from the blue..."""
Neku,"Wait, seriously? Then you were with the Black Skullers! "
Joshua,Meet the architect of Tin Pin's success. Shinji Hashimoto... The
Neku,Him!? He's the Producer!?
Wizard,"Impressive as always, Joshua. I knew I couldn't fool you. "
Joshua,Why would you go along with those thieves? 
Wizard,I was confident. Confident in the possibilities.
Joshua,That Dr. Pin would complete the Omega Slammer? 
Wizard,A team works smoothest when it focuses on the goal at hand-- on
Joshua,So this was all just part of your grand scheme? 
Wizard,"There are no concidences in this world, Joshua. Only cause and"
Neku,Including our meetng you here? 
Wizard,"Of course. Now, how about a game of Tin Pin? Let me see how far"
Shooter,"Me! Me! Ohh, ME!"
Wizard,I'll select my own opponent. 
Shooter,What? How come!? 
Wizard,Cause and effect. Blue. I choose you.
Neku,Me?
Wizard,"Now, let us begin. Face the Wizard of Slam's might!"
Neku,Nngh! He's... he's not human! His technique is ridiculous!
Wizard,"Come, now. Surely you can do better."
Neku,One more... Let's play one more time!
Wizard,As you wish.
Neku,YES!
Wizard,"Well done, Kindred Spirits! See how inseparable Tin Pin has made"
Shooter,Inserparable... and inpincible!
Wizard,"Ha ha, indeed. My work here is done. I trust Shibuya will be in"
Shooter,"Wait, you're LEAVING? But we just got to meet you..."
Wizard,Someone has to spread Tin Pin to the masses. We all have our 
Neku,He... He's gone.
Shooter,Wonder where he's going... I hope we see him again soon! 
Neku,"Count on it! (Tin Pin, you are a trick of fate... A microcosm of my"
Neku,Hmm?
Neku,Mr. Hanekoma? ...... (Wonder what he's up to out here.) ...... (I think
Neku,(This place seems... familiar. Did he go upstairs?)
Neku,(I wonder what Mr. Hanekoma's doing here.) ...... (He's kind of a
Neku,(It's been a couple years now... I was looking at the Udagawa wall tag.
Neku,(It seems like he's been really busy lately. His shop's been closed a

Neku,(I'll never forget that day... We were set to meet up at the usual 
Neku,Mr. Hanekoma! What are you doing up here? 
Neku,Phones? What's that?
Neku,"Are you OK, Mr. Hanekoma? Ane what are you doing all the way up here?"
Neku,Check what?
Neku,"...... Look, Mr. H... I want to help you! I want to pay you back for "
Neku,"You just seem so busy lately! I mean, I know I probably can't do much,"
Neku,"Really!? I'm happy to work the café, or clean up or whatever!"
Neku,... 'Scuse me?
Neku,"Mr. Hanekoma, what's gotten into you? "
Neku,Mr. Hanekoma... Why are you attack--
Neku,What? 
Neku,"Wha-- Wait! Please, wait! What on earth... Was that really even him? "
Neku,"Hey, got time to play me in Tin Pin?"
Shiki,"Tin Pin? Sorry, not right now. I have to get over to Molco."
Neku,... Oh.
Shiki,For the slam-off. Aren't you going? I thought all the boys were...
Neku,"Oh, I'm going... I just figured I'd warm up first."
Shiki,"Gotcha. Hmm... Oh, what the hey. One round. I can make time."
Neku,Sweet! Get ready...
Shiki,Woo hoo! Go me!
Neku,Ugh... How could I lose?
Shiki,Maybe I have a shot at becoming champion after all.
Neku,Why do you want to be champion?
Shiki,"Oh, I have my reasons..."
Neku,"(... Like? Hmph, whatever.)"
Shiki,"Hey, no fair!"
Neku,What's not fair?
Shiki,Since when are you so good?
Neku,... Since when are you so BAD? 
Shiki,There go my dreams of becoming the champ...
Neku,"The price of sucking, I'm afraid."
Shiki,I know! Why don't YOU become the champion?
Neku,"Um... OK? I mean, that was the plan."
Shiki,"Then, after he gives you the prize, shake my hand. Promise!"
Neku,(... After WHO gives me the prize?)
Neku,(This is the Shibuya River. I can't think of any reason to go in there
Sota,"Well, here there, tiger! "
Neku,"Oh, hey, Mr. Sota!"
Sota,Decided to grow out your mane? 
Neku,"Oh, this? Naw. I need to get it cut. "
Sota,"Rawr! Then tell ya what, sport. Drop by my place and we'll get your "
Neku,"Well, I'd like to, but... See, right now... "
Sota,Wuh-oh. Lemme guess. The slam-off?
Neku,Yeah. You know about it? I thought you didn't play. 
Sota,I took it up! Better late than never. 
Neku,Really!? Then how 'bout a match? 
Sota,"Sure, champ. Just go easy on me!"
Sota,I... I won!?
Neku,Are you serious? (I lost to a beginner?)
Sota,"Wow, that was a blast! Maybe I should enter the slam-off."
Neku,Couldn't hurt! (Just be ready for payback.)
Sota,"Aight, dawg! Molco, here I come!"
Neku,"(...Did Mr. Sota just call me ""dawg""? Where'd he pick THAT "
Sota,"Well, dang! I've got a ways to go."
Neku,I think you did great for just starting out.
Sota,"Thanks, tiger! I had a blast. Maybe I should enter the slam-off."
Neku,Couldn't hurt!
Sota,Good deal. So how 'bout that trim? You can be my haircut model! 
Neku,"Um, OK?  (""Haircut model""? Is that a euphemism for ""guinea pig""? My "
Neku,"Hey, wanna play me in Tin Pin?"
Techie,Tin Pin? I'm kinda workin' right now. Got some errands.
Neku,"Oh... OK, later."
Techie,"Hey hey, hold up! You don't have to give in so easily! This is Japan."
Neku,Sigh... You won't forget to run your errands? 
Techie,No! Of course not.
Neku,"(""No"" meaning ""yes""?)"
Techie,"Yeeeah! Take that! C'mon, one more match for good measure."
Neku,What about your errands?
Techie,"Eh, work can wait. They're not the boss of me."
Neku,"(... Um, aren't they?)"
Techie,"Oh, hold up. Today's that slam-off at Molco..."
Neku,(Right... I'd better head over of I'll miss registration.)
Techie,... Perfect! I'm gonna enter!
Neku,(... And your errands?)
Techie,"Damn! I lost. C'mon, one more match! "
Neku,Don't you have errands to run?
Techie,"Aw, crap! That's right. You better enter the slam-off at Molco!"
Neku,I will.
Techie,Good! Be ready for vengeance!
NekU,(... And your errands?)
Neku,Uhh... Hello? ...... (Nobody's home. Guess I'll try back later.)
Neku,"Hey, wanna play me in Tin Pin?"
Ai,"Tin Pin? Sure, for a little while. But then I have to go to Molco."
Neku,You're entering the slam-off?
Ai,Yup yup! But mostly to get my prints on the Prince.
Neku,(Get your... what?)
Ai,I've never actually played Tin Pin before. This'll be good practice!
Ai,Whoa! How did THAT happen!?
Neku,"Stupid, Neku, stupid! (How could I lose to a beginner?)"
Ai,Hmm... Could be I'm champion material.
Neku,(Ugh... I've created a monster.)
Ai,"And if I win, the Prince will TOUCH ME when he hands me the"
Neku,"(... That explains the sudden interest in Tin Pin. Well, "
Ai,"Aww... I lost. Oh, well. It WAS my first time."
Neku,"(Actually, that was still pretty sad...)"
Ai,Good luck at the slam-off. Hope you win.
Neku,That's the plan.
Ai,Then the Prince himself will hand you the grand prize!
Neku,(... And that's why you're entering?)
Neku,"Hey, wanna play me in Tin Pin?"
Makoto,Tin Pin? Sorry. I'm looking for somebody right now.
Neku,Who?
Makoto,"We're holding an event at Molco, but our special guest, the Prince, "
Neku,"Oh, well. Maybe another time, then."
Makoto,"Hey! Wait a sec! So you like Tin Pin? You should read our magazine,"
Neku,"You work for PW? I buy every issue! The ""Pinside Edition"" feature is my"
Makoto,"Ha ha, yeah. That's our most popular column. You know... what the "
Makoto,Eh... heh heh... Oops! I won. Sorry...
Neku,(Dang it! I had him... If only I'd--)
Makoto,"Oh, now cheer up. You had a rough game, but I know talent"
Neku,"At this rate, I'll never win the slam-off."
Makoto,Sure you will. Just keep reading Pinhead Weekly!
Neku,"Yeah... I think I will! (Hey, wait... Was this all a sales"
Makoto,Darn! I seem to have lost! You gave me quite a workout.
Neku,(Um... right.)
Makoto,So tell me... Where'd you learn to play like that?
Neku,"Well... from Pinhead Weekly, I guess."
Makoto,You're KIDDING! ... Tell your friends!
Neku,(Did he just lose on purpose to push a few extra subscriptions? Geez...
Neku,"Hey, wanna play me in Tin Pin?"
Megumi,Tin Pin? Heh heh... Take me on and it may be the last game you ever

Beat,"Hells yeah! I love me some Tin Pin! Oh, but... you should just go to"
Neku,For the slam-off?
Beat,"You know about it? Then whatchu hangin' around here for, man? You can"
Neku,I know. I just wanted to warm up.
Beat,Hmm... I was finna grab me some curry beforehand. Shame I have to call
Neku,"Nah, it's cool. I'll hit somebody else up."
Beat,Bwaaah! No no wait! I'll play ya!
Neku,"(If you want to play, just come out and say it!)"
Beat,Aight. Get ready!
Beat,"Heh, I won. Eat it, yo!"
Neku,(Dammit.)
Beat,"Aight, man, curry's on you! Le's go."
Neku,"(Nice of you to mention that NOW.) What about the slam-off,"
Beat,Oh... right! Curry takes a rain check.
Neku,(Enough about the curry! The kid's obsessed...)
Beat,"Damn! I lost... Yo, you good, man."
Neku,"I'm all right, I guess."
Beat,Too bad... I was gonna treat ya to curry if I won.
Neku,(Funny you mention that after LOSING.)
Beat,"Well, I gotta bounce. See ya at the slam-off, man."
Neku,"Yup. (I hope so. If I face him, I'm bound to win.)"
Neku,"Hey, wanna play me in Tin Pin?"
Mina,"Tin Pin? Hmm, I'm not very good."
Neku,That's OK.

Mina,"Heh, all right. You're on!"
Mina,No way... I won!?
Neku,(Dang it...)
Mina,You think I could win the slam-off?

Mina,Ooh! Look at the time! I'd better go sign up!
Mina,See? I told you.
Neku,"Naw, you did great. "
Mina,Really? Thanks! So you're playing in the slam-off? Good luck. I hope 
Neku,I'll win.
Mina,Ooh! Look at the time! You'd better get going. 
Neku,"Hey, wanna play me in Tin Pin?"
Guy,Tin Pin? Why not sign up for the slam-off at Molco?
Neku,I am. I just wanted to warm up first.
Guy,"Oh, good for you! Actually, I'm the event's sponsor."
Neku,"Oh, cool!"
Guy,"You should hurry along, though. You don't want to miss"
Neku,"Hey, that's right! (I'd better get over to Molco.)"
Neku,Excuse me--
Prince,My autograph? Sure. 
Neku,"Whoa, wha-- Why are you writing on my clothes!?"
Prince,Huh?
Neku,This is permanent marker! It won't wash out!
Prince,You wanted my autograph...
Neku,"No! No, I didn't. Why would I? You're a total stranger!"
Prince,Don't you know who I am?
Neku,(Like I care.)
Prince,"My name is Eiji Oji, but some call me... the Prince? TV personality?"
Neku,(Weirdo? Egomaniac? Vandal?)
Prince,I can't believe you've never heard of me. Don't you follow the 
Neku,Wh-who cares!? My parents say TV warps the mind.
Prince,"Oh, you poor thing. You're like a bird in a cage. However do you "
Neku,That's easy. Tin Pin Slammer!

Neku,I'm not down! 
Prince,"Hey, why don't we take a picture? I'll post it to my blog"
Neku,(Nooo thank you. You want everybody to know I lost?)
Prince,"Come on, don't be shy. I'll put a bar over your eyes. No "
Neku,"Sorry, but no!"
Prince,Look at him run. So bashful!
Prince,"Well, well. Not too shabby."
Neku,"Well, duh. I live for this game."
Prince,Oh ho! Edgy! I like it.
Neku,I'm not edgy...
Prince,Hey! Why don't we take a pciture? I'll post it to my blog.
Neku,(Nooo thank you.)
Prince,"Come on, don't be shy. I'll put a bar over your eyes. No one will"
Neku,"Sorry, but no!"
Prince,Look at him run. So bashful!
Neku,"Hey, wanna play me in--"
Joshua,"Say, did you know? We all perceive the world around us differently,"
Neku,Huh!? (Is this kid high?)
Joshua,So if you're wondering why a certain young lady still looks like
Neku,Young lady?
Joshua,The only thing stopping you from seeing what she really looks like...
Neku,I need to look harder?
Joshua,That's right. Let go of your preconceptions.
Neku,"Um... you know... I was just gonna ask if you wanted to play Tin Pin,"
Joshua,Hmm? Tin Pin? We already played.
Neku,What? We did not!
Joshua,"Weren't you listening? Like I said, you only see what you want to "
Neku,(How come I always pick the crazies to talk to...)
Joshua,"When you're drowning in a sea of work with not enough time, why pour"
Neku,Whew... (What was that all about? Kid plays too many video games.)
Neku,"Hey, wanna play me in Tin Pin?"
Nao,"Tin Pin? But, like, I need to go to Molco."
Neku,You're entering the slam-off?
Nao,"Like, yeah? The Prince is gonna be there to present the grand prize? His"
Neku,"(The Prince's prints? Hmm... She means business. But is she good?) Hey,"
Nao,"Like, sure? But just one."
Nao,Super yay! I won!
Neku,(Not good...)
Nao,"Now I, like, know I can win?"
Neku,(Over my dead body.)
Nao,"So, like, thanks? See you at Molco."
Neku,(Hmph. Next time you're goin' down.)
Nao,"Ohh! I lost. You're, like, good at it?"
Neku,"I'm OK, I guess."
Nao,"That was really good practice! Now I, like, really think I can win?"
Neku,(Hmm... She's a tough nut to crack.)
Nao,"So, like, thanks? See you at Molco."
Nao,"Heeey, it's Shiki! You gonna, like, have the stuff ready? Only seven "
Shiki,"I'm on it! Once he sees what we're all wearing, the Prince is going to"
Neku,"(""Stuff""? What the heck are they planning?)"
Joshua,"Say, Green. What are you making? "
Shiki,"T-Shirts with letters stitched onto them. We're gonna, like, wear 'em "
Neku,Dare I ask what?
Nao,"Super Princely Birthday Love Magic? He's gonna, like, totally love it?"
Neku,......
Shiki,I hear he's really into Tin Pin these days.
Nao,"Yeah, I read! So I, like, took it up, too?"
Shiki,"Hey, why don't we play? "
Nao,"Like, sure?"
Nao,"Wow, I, like, totally won? "
Neku,Rrgh... 
Neo,"I'll play you anytime you want? Just, like, let me know? "
Nao,"Wanna, like, play again?"
Neku,"Like, yeah? But this time I wanna win?"
Nao,"Ha ha, we'll see about that."
Shiki,"Go, Black 'n' BLue! You're a genius!"
Neku,(... Please stop with the codenames.)
Nao,"Well, here's my pin. I'm so, like, jealous, Shiki? You've got your "
Shiki,"Oh, this? This kind of just happened..."
Shooter,"What are you saying, Green!? We kindred Spirits are bound by FATE! "
Neku,(Not only did he name us after crayons-- apparently he's been EATING
Shiki,"Don't worry about the shirts, Nao-Nao. They'll be ready."
Nao,Awesome!
Neku,(Pork City...)
Beat,"Yo, wassup?"
Neku,"Oh, I was just thinking about going in here."

Prince,In the flesh! Care for an autograph?
Shiki,Aaaaaah! It's the P-P-P- Puh Puh Puh Puh Puh Puh Puhhhhhh... 
Joshua,I think Green's having a stroke.
Prince,"Hey, you three were finalists at the slam-off. Do you usually all "
Shooter,WOW! You know about us?
Prince,Tin Pin's my latest little addiction. I know everything there is to
Shooter,"Go for it, Green! You're a Prince fan, right?"
Shiki,WHAT!? No way! nowaynowaynowaynowaynowaynoway!
Joshua,There she goes again. You'd think she'd be dying for quality time 
Shiki,It's too embarrassing!
Shooter,As opposed to wearing weird T-shirts at some party?
Shiki,HEY! We're going to look awesome!
Neku,"(Whoops, now she's mad.)"
Shiki,B-b-but yeah! I totally can't play the Prince! B-B-B-Blue! You do it!
Neku,... Fine. 
Shiki,And don't you dare beat him.
Neku,(Whose side is she on?)
Prince,Looks like someone still has a few things to learn.
Neku,Rrgh... 
Prince,I'm always happy to teach.
Prince,Another round of Tin Pin?
Neku,Better believe it.
Prince,"All right, then. Whenever you're ready."
Prince,Dethroned! How... unfortunate. But I'd expect no less from a 
Shiki,"I do not BELIEVE you, Black 'n' Blue! I TOLD you not to win!"
Neku,... Help!
Shiki,Y-Your Highness! I'm so sorry my brain-dead friend has no manners! 
Prince,Don't be silly. I had fun. Let's play again soon.
Shiki,"Y-yes, sir! If he pleases you, sir, he's yours to play with anytime!!!"
Neku,(... I'm what?)
Shiki,Wow... He's gorgeous.
Neku,(... I'm WHAT?)
Prof,"Howdy, Neku."
Neku,"Oh, hey, Pin Prof."
Shooter,Pin Prof!? Is he friends with Dr. Pin!?
Neku,I just call him that because he knows all about pins. He's not like 
Shooter,"Wow, you know all about pins?"
Prof,"A bit. See, first of all: you say pins? I say sharp design. All those"
Neku,(NO! Stupid kid got him started! Now he won't shut up for at least 
Shooter,"Yeah, I'd love to see your best pin, Prof! "
Prof,"Sure, guys. Hey, if you can beat me, Neku, I'll give you one. It's"
Neku,Seriously!?
Shooter,"You better win, Blue!"
Prof,"Ha ha! Tough luck, kiddo."

Prof,"You here to play, Neku? "
Neku,"Yes, sir!"
Prof,All righty! Let's get to it.
Shooter,Yeah! You won!
Prof,"Almost had you. Well, here you go, guys. "
Shooter,"This is your top pin, Prof? I can see why! It's sparkling! "
Prof,I talk to 'em as I polish 'em every day. Pins are a guy's best friend.
Shooter,"Wow, Pin Prof! Such WISDOM!"
Neku,(That's... That's actually kind of creepy.)
Shooter,"I'll start talking to mind, too! Thanks for the hot tip!"
Prof,"Oh, and when you go to polish your pins... be careful what sort of "
Neku,"(NOOO! He's winding up! We're looking at five straight days!) Sorry,"
Mina,"Hiya, Shiki. You're going to the Prince's Birthday Bash, right? "
Shiki,"Do you need to ask? It's, like, the most important day of the year. "
Mina,"Great, that makes all of the White Angels!"
Neku,White Angels?
Joshua,One of the Prince's fan gangs. They're at war.
Neku,(A fan gang war?)
Mina,"Those Black Diablo posers are showing up, too. We've gotta be ready! "
Neku,"(Angels and Diablos? That seems... kinda off.) ... Yeah, that's all"
Mina,"Oh, sorry! I was off in Prince Land."
Neku,(... Right.)
Shiki,"Good luck, Blue!"
Mina,Woo! I won! 
Neku,Rrgh...
Mina,We should do that again!
Mina,Want to play some Tin Pin?
Neku,Yeah... This time I'm serious!
Mina,"Heh heh, bring it!"
Shiki,Yay! 
Mina,"Aww... Here, this is yours."
Shooter,THANKS! We'll put your White Angel soul to good use!
Mina,Heh heh. See you at the Bash.
Shiki,Yup yup!
Mina,"Have fun slamming and all, but don't forget to be ready for those"
Ai,"Oh, hey, Beat."
Beat,"Yo, Ai! "
Shiki,"Is this your girlfriend, Yellow?"
Beat,"Naw, she lives in my 'hood. We've been friends since forever."
Shiki,"Aww, that's sweet."
Ai,Beat always shows me his material.
Neku,"(Material? What, does his family sell fabric?)"
Ai,"Oh, that reminds me! Do that one from before again! "
Beat,Bwaaah! ... Shh! That one's still a secret!
Ai,HA HA HA! Your face is hilarious.
Shiki,"Yellow, you look like you jumped out of a comic book!"
Beat,"Shut it, Green! "
Ai,His comedy routine is the bomb.
Neku,(Ohh. ... He does stand-up?)
Beat,"A-anyway! C'mon, le's get some Tin Pin up in here. You game, Ai?"
Ai,"Sure! I had most of my pins ganked at the slam-off, but I have enough "
Ai,Yaaay! You lose. 
Beat,Hey!
Ai,"Ha ha, let's go again."
Ai,Want to go again?
Beat,You gotta ask?
Ai,"Ha ha, OK. Here we go!"
Beat,Yeah! 
Ai,"Boo! Fine, take this."
Beat,"Thanks, Ai!"
Shooter,Don't worry! We'll get the rest of you
Ai,If you say so... Sounds like you're on a mission. Good luck. 
Shooter,Leave it to us! 
Ai,"You too, Beat. With Tin Pin... and with your act."
Beat,Bwaaah! ... Shh! That's a SECRET! 
Ai,HA HA HA! That face never gets old.
Tech,"'Sup, Beat?"
Beat,"Na' much, man."
Shiki,"Hey, Futoshi. How's work at A-East?"
Beat,"You know the F-Bomb too, Green?"
Shiki,"F-Bomb? Ha ha, sort of. I'm at A-East, like, every week to see the"
Beat,"Oh, so you're there to watch."
Joshua,"As opposed to what, Yellow?"
Tech,Beat here opens with a stand-up act.
Beat,Bwaaah! I said to tell NO ONE!
Shooter,Why hide it? You should be advertising! 
Beat,"Step off my grill, Red! 'Sides... We done. "
Tech,"What, you two broke it off?"
Beat,"She didn't gimme no choice, yo."
Shiki,"You don't have to tell us you don't want, but..."
Joshua,...... Let's play a little game. Blue here plays your F-Bomb. If he
Tech,"You down with that, Beat?"
Beat,Bwaaah! How is THAT fair? 
Neku,Sounds like I can't afford to lose this fight.
Tech,"Whatever, kid. But just so you know... I can control two pins at the "
Neku,No way!
Tech,Way.
Tech,Wah waaah! My win.
Neku,Rrgh... 
Tech,"I'll take you on anytime, kid. I'm not busy."
Tech,Mmm? Tin Pin again?
Neku,"C'mon, let's do this."
Tech,Sigh... Yeah. OK.
Neku,Done!
Shooter,"OK, Yellow! Go on, get it out of your system!"
Beat,"...... Me 'n Rhyme... My sister, yeah? We were doin' the comedy bit. "
Shiki,That's cute! I love stand-up. Tell us one of your jokes!
Beat,... I got fired. She fired me.
Shiki,Ouch... 
Shooter,"Aww, don't let it get to you. Show a little spirit! A little Kindred"
Beat,"I just might do that, yo! I have more fun slammin' anyway."
Neku,This is...
Joshua,The Shibuya River. It stretches 2.6 km between the Miyamasu and
Shiki,What!? A sewer?
Beat,An' you finna go in there?
Neku,There could be something inside.
Shiki,"Sorry, but I'll pass. These boots were so not made for sewer-walking."
Beat,"Yeah, this ain't my style either, yo."
Neku,"I guess that's understandable. All right, I'll go check it out."
Joshua,"Whoa there, Black 'n' Blue. I'm going with. "
Neku,You? You seem the LAST person who'd want to go in there. 
Joshua,I could never live with myself if I let you go alone. Let's spend 
Beat,"Whoa ho ho! You guys are... Like, you ain't..."
Shiki,"Blue and Pink!? Sure, they go.. but I didn't know they went LIKE THAT!"
Neku,Now look what you've done!
Joshua,"Hee hee... Shut up and walk, dear."
Shiki,"... I'm going, too. If something happens, I want to see... I mean stop"
Beat,"Whatever, I'll go, too."
Neku,(Sigh...)
Shiki,What... what IS this place?
Beat,Uh... it's a river.
Joshua,Like a channel dividing this world from the next...
Neku,The Styx of Shibuya? 
Shiki,"Hey, c'mon. Don't make this creepier than it has to be."
Joshua,It's a common misconception that Charon ferried the dead across the
Neku,Thrilling.
Shiki,"But, like... this ins't really the Styx, is it? "
Neku,Does this look like Greece to you? Just ignore him. 
Beat,The hell is this place!?
Shiki,No joke! It's like Chez Sewer's Bar and Lounge down here!
Neku,Seriously...
Joshua,......
Shooter,"Hey, bro! Let's play some Tin Pin!"
VW,"Sure, all right."
Joshua,Wait... 
VW,Close! But actually I'm second in line: The Vice Wizard of Slam.
Shooter,WHOA! So do you have secret tips for winning at Tin Pin?
VW,"A couple, yeah."
Shooter,WHOA! Teach me? Woo! I'm totally gonna level up!
VW,That's if you win.
Shooter,"Awright, you're ON!"
VW,"Just so you know, I'm wicked tough. I can control three pins at once. "
Shooter,Wha--
VW,Ready GO!
VW,"Ooh, too bad! "
Shooter,He's good... Too good! 
VW,I'm sure you'll get me next time. Come back whenever you want 
VW,More Tin Pin?
Shooter,"Yes, please! Gimme gimme!"
VW,"Heh heh, sure. Grab your pins! "
Shooter,Yeah! I win!
VW,Augh... I blew it. One more time! 
Shooter,"Wait, where's my secret tip? "
VW,"Oh, my bad. Right. It's all about concentration. You've gotta focus every"
Shooter,OK! 
VW,"Then, picture yourself winning in your mind."
Shooter,Right!
VW,Then you'll always win! 
Shooter,Um... A little more specific? 
VW,It's also important to have a victory pose decided on before you play.
Shooter,"Oh, c'mon. That advice stinks!"
VW,"Hey, don't bite the hand that feeds you, kid."
Shooter,"Right, SORRY! Umm... I'll work on focusing and imagining!"
Neku,(Poor kid can't see he's being messed with.)
Neku,Whoa... This graffiti is--
Joshua,CAT's work.
Neku,"It looks like the wall tag in Udagawa... (Then wait, was that last"
Shiki,"You all right, Black 'n' Blue? C'mon."
Neku,OK... 
Neku,This place is huge!
Shiki,I never knew Shibuya had a basement
Joshua,This is the Room of Reckoning. That throne seats the one who rules
Neku,What? 
Joshua,"Say, Neku... What would you do if I asked you to play a game with me"
Neku,I'd think you were crazy!
Shiki,Hey! There's somebody in here!
Neku,What!?
Joshua,"Hello there, Neku."
Neku,Wh-wh-what the heck!? 
Joshua,"I suppose I should say, nice to meet you... in this world."
Shiki,Pink has a t-twin!?
Beat,"OK, yo, this ain't funny! Who led us into the hall a' mirrors!?"
Joshua,I come from a world parallel to this one. Existence branched and our
Neku,A parallel world? 
Joshua,"I ran into a spot of trouble there. Nothing major. Heh, about one"
Beat,No wonder they keep this kid locked in the basement! 
Joshua,So your world isn't peaceful?
Joshua,At the moment? Not exactly. But I assume Neku is holding down the 
Neku,Me?
Joshua,"The other Neku. From my world. Anyway, I'm expecting my ride home... "
Neku,Your ride? 
Joshua,Say! Let's play a game to kill some time. I always wanted to duke it
Neku,Duke it out? 
Joshua,"Yes, but my Neku is busy with the Game. Can't really bother him."
Neku,"Wait, hold up. Why should I fight you? "
Joshua,I told you. I'm just looking to kill some time. But let's see... If 
Neku,"Well... Yeah, I guess. "
Joshua,Hee hee... Just tell me when you're ready. And be ready. I dont' 
Joshua,Ready?
Joshua,"Hee hee... Whenever you're ready, Neku."
Joshua,Then let's begin.
Neku,Hah!
Joshua,"Nice work, Neku. I knew I was right to pick you. ... Not that you're"
Joshua,Hello again. Here to pass the time?
Joshua,"Fabulous, Neku. You won again. Hee hee... You sure know how to show "
Yammer,"Hi, Shooter."
Shooter,"Hey there, Yammer!"
Neku,"Yammer? Someone actually named their kid ""Yammer""?"
Shooter,"Yeah, he's my BFF! He's the one who told me about Tin Pin! He knows"
Yammer,"Yeah, but all that knowledge doesn't help me actually win. Shooter's"
Shooter,"Nice back-handed compliment, dude!"
Yammer,"Well, anyway, Shooter's good under pressure. If there was to get an"
Neku,(Or at least one freaky Tin Pin love-child...)
Shooter,"C'mon, Yammer! Let's play! We need to gather up pins!"
Yammer,"I understand. I'm a victim, too. So I'll help... by destroying you "
Yammer,"Hah! I'm telling you, my pins pwn!"
Shooter,"MAN, I can't believe I lost to Yammer..."
Yammer,I'll play you again anytime you want. I'll be here
Yammer,Ready to play a round?
Shooter, Yeah!
Yammer,"Heh. All right, then... Taste my re-re-re-tooled Yammer"
Yammer,"Fast as ever, Shooter... This is the only pin I've got. ...... "
Shooter,"Thanks, Yammer! I'll take real good care of it!"
Yammer,"Oh! And some of the mods on it are really expensive, so be careful "
Shooter,OK! Will do!
Yammer,"Oh! And if you lose to somebody, give them a different pin! Don't "
Shooter,OK! Will do!
Yammer,Oh! And--
Neku,(I almost feel bad taking the kid's pin. Almost.)
Beat,"Aw, no! Mrs. K!?"
Konishi,Beat? My goodness. I trust my seeing you loitering about here means
Beat,It's my life. Who needs her!? As... as long as I got me Tin Pin an'
Joshua,Ugh. Who does Yellow think he's fooling? He's practically dripping
Beat,......
Konishi,"Listen carefully, Beat. We're going to play Tin Pin now. If I win..."
Beat,What!? How's that work out? 
Konishi,"Come to me, Beat."
Beat,Rrgh... Aight. You leave me no choice... but to pit you against Blue
Neku,"What!? Hey, don't drag me into this! (... Why do I bother resisting?)"
Konishi,Hee hee... I don't care who plays me. Every little lamb is equal in
special,Divide and Conquer!
Konishi,My tactics are never wrong.
Neku,Rrgh...
Konishi,Frustrated? Then come back for another schooling.
Konishi,Hmm? You wish to know defeat again? 
Neku,"Yeah! ... I mean, no! Look, just play!"
Konishi,Very well. Let's begin the lesson.
Neku,Oh... Whoops. I won.
Beat,"You da man, B 'n' B!"
Konishi,"Yes, yes. Here's a pin for you. Oh, and Beat? Do be sure to patch"
Beat,"I won, Mrs. K. I'ma live how I like."
Neku,Maybe I shoulda lost...
Joshua,"Don't be silly, Black 'n' Blue. You merely played your part. What"
Neku,"Yeah, but... (Stop calling me Black 'n' Blue. Seriously.)"
guy,"Hoo, boy..."
Joshua,Mr. President! Awful shame about the slam-off.
guy,You call that a shame? Try a catastrophe.
Joshua,Any ideas about who's behind it?
guy,Not a clue. They used a fake company name.
Neku,"But the commentator- they said he was deputy editor at PW, right?"
guy,"Another lie. How about you, Joshua? Any ideas? Could you ask "
Neku,"(He has people? Evil, talking bats I'd believe... but people?)"
Joshua,I'll see what I can see.
Shooter,"Hey, mister, let's SLAM!"
Boss,Well... all right. Just be ready. This prez has got skillz!
guy,"Ha ha, try again in a few decades. Age is a fine"
Shooter,Rrgh... He's good.
Guy,Wanna go another round? I could use the distraction.
Guy,Hmm? Tin Pin?
Shooter,I feel a win coming on!
Guy,"Ha ha! We'll see about that, kiddo."
Guy,"Excellent technique... Here, take this."
Shooter,Woohoo!
Guy,You kids have got moxie. It does my heart good to see young 
Joshua,You mean it does your wallet good.
Guy,"Can't it be both? Anyhow, I should move along."
Neku,"(OK, so this kid's not just some lunatic. He's a sharp, well-connected"
Sota,"Hey, tiger! Whoa, that mane is completely out of control."
Neku,It does kinda get in my eyes. I could use a cut.
Shooter,"Friend of yours, Blue? "
Neku,Hey's my stylist.
Sota,"Been whackin' this boy's hair fo ages now, ever since he was a little"
Shooter,Nice! What was Blue like as a kid? 
Sota,"Neku? He'd come in with clippings and say, ""Do me like""--"
Neku,OK! Enough with the talking!
Joshua,"Hee hee... ""Do me like this!"" You were that guy."
Sota,And get this! The clippings were from--
Neku,MORE than enough with the talking!
Shooter,"Hey, Blue! If you lose this round of Tin Pin, you've gotta tell us! "
Sota,"Ooh, Tin Pin? That sounds like a fair deal."
Neku,Don't I get a veto?
Sota,"Well, I'll be! I won!"
Neku,Rrgh... 
Sota,That was fun. Let's play again!
Sota,"Up for some Tin Pin, tiger?"
Neku,If it'll keep your mouth shut!
Sota,Then let's get slammin'!
Neku,THANK YOU!
Sota,"Just wait till I get my scissors at you, champ."
Shooter,"Aww, no fun! I wanted to hear Blue's big secret!"
Shiki,"Yeah, what's so embarrassing about bringing in clippings? I'll grab "
Joshua,"See, but you're clipping from fashion mags, not comic books."
Neku,Hey!!! How did you...
Joshua,No way. You seriously brought in comics? Hee hee.
Neku,"(Stupid, Neku, stupid!)"
Shooter,"So you're really a big geek, Blue?"
Neku,"Look, are we done here!? Let's just move on, OK!?"
Megumi,"Ahh, Joshua. A shame we couldn't cross pins at the slam-off. I was"
Neku,Who's this guy?
Joshua,He's the mayor.
Neku,Of Shibuya!? (How far up do this kid's connections go?)
Joshua,"So, now that Tin Pin has a criminal element, will the city step in "
Megumi,"Over my cold, dead body. Tin Pin is still full of so many"
Joshua,Hee hee... You're quite taken with it. I thought you considered it
Megumi,"I did, once. But prejudice is an ugly thing. I should have given it a"
Shooter,That's great! Let's play now!
Megumi,Very well. If that is what you choose... my two-headed serpent slam
Megumi,Heh. You simply aren't ready.
Shooter,He's... he's not HUMAN!
Megumi,Return when you have what it takes.
Megumi,"Tin Pin again, is it?"
Shooter,We play until I win!
Megumi,Or until I die of old age. Whichever comes first.
Shooter,Yes! I won!
Megumi,Wonderful... I see now why he picked you... Unnngh... I concede 
Shooter,"Thanks, I will! YOINK!"
Joshua,We're looking for the ones who took all the pins. Do you know 
Megumi,"Alas, I do not. Though that large man seemed somehow familiar..."
Joshua,"...... Thanks, we'll take it from here."
Neku,"(Large man? Oh. Right. How could I forget the ""booth babe""?)"
Joshua,"Well, well. Look who it is. Big surprise at the slam-off, hmm?"
Makoto,Oh! Joshua! You topped the reader response survey again last week!
Shooter,"Friend of yours, Pink?"
Joshua,Indeed. I owe a lot to this gentleman.
Makoto,Nonsense. We at PW owe you far more! Joshua here writes a column for 
Neku,A column? About what?
Joshua,Hee hee. About things beyond your wildest fantasies.
Neku,Huh!? (What the hell does THAT mean?)
Shooter,"Hey, mister! Play us at Tin Pin!"
Makoto,"Sorry, guys. I've got a prep meeting at the magazine. ... Oh, twist "
Joshua,"Beautiful. If we win, you extend my deadline."
Makoto,"Wait, what? Oh, man, I hope I win this!"
Makoto,Woo! I win! 
Neku,Rrgh... 
Makoto,"Boy, I love Tin Pin. I can never play just one round."
Makoto,Up for a quick game of Tin Pin?
Neku,I'm up for a quick win!
Makoto,"Ha ha, we'll see about that."
Makoto,Sigh... Lost again. You're good! Joshua sure knows how to pick 'em. 
Joshua,Thanks for that extension.
Makoto,No! You can't... I can't...
Shooter,So this deadline-- what's it for?
Makoto,"His column, of course. He's the middle-school columnist for ""Pinhead"
Shooter,WHOA! That's my favorite part of PW!
Shiki,Yeah! I picked up an issue-- mainly 'cause the Prince was on the 
Beat,"It's the only thing I read, yo."
Neku,"Wow, you guys. I always scrap it. (... In an acid-proof scrapbook"
Joshua,What a shame. I'm sure you'd love it.
Neku,(I'll die before I talk.)
Shooter,"So... if he doesn't make his deadline, "
Makoto,He doesn't make the magazine.
Shooter,WHAT!? I can't let that happen! 
Shiki,Seriously! Your publisher friend's practically in tears.
Beat,"Dontchu make me pound it outta ya, Pink."
Neku,Just write the stupid column.
Makoto,"Wow, guys... You really care about Pinhead Weekly. I... I'm gonna "
Joshua,"Ugh, fine. I'll have it to you on time. You have my word as a"
Shooter,"Hey, mister! Let's play Tin Pin!"
H,"Energetic little thing, ain't ya? I'd love to play, kid... but I'm"
Neku,"Like what, Mr. H? I could help you look."
Joshua,"Hmm? A friend of yours? It's odd to see you so cooperative, Bruise."
Neku,"(""Bruise""? I see we're jumping right to the point.) Mr. Hanekoma's the"
Joshua,How charming.
Shooter,So? What are you looking for? 
H,Some reports I've written.
Neku,Reports?
H,"Just some passing thoughts. Tying up loose ends, that sorta thing. I"
Neku,But they're important?
H,"Definitely. Ugh, this is a fine mess."
Neku,"If we see them anywhere, we'll grab them."
H,"Thanks, Neku. Just swear you'll never, ever read them. Ever. Forever."
Neku,Uhh... Sure. (OK... What the heck did he write in them?)
777,"Hey, it's Beat 'n' Rhyme!"
Beat,"'Sup, Sevens."
Shiki,Omigosh! You're 777! I'm such a huge fan!
777,"Really? Domo arigato, babe."
Neku,I thought she was a Prince fan.
Joshua,"Hmm? What's that, Black 'n' Blue? You say you're JEALOUS?"
Neku,Wha- NO! And I thought SHE was Black now!
777,You two got any hot new jokes?
Rhyme,We're kind of on a break right now. Thought we might give Tin Pin a 
777,That's kind of a shame. I loved seeing you make Beat pull that face.
Beat,"Yo, right? I'm a genius."
Rhyme,Or just dim.
Beat,R-Rhyme...
Neku,"(Wow, she really cut him down. Wonder what happened...)"
Shiki,Umm... Hey! Why don't we play a round of Tin Pin?
Shooter,YEAH! We're gathering pins! Because we're the Kindred Spirits!
777,That's... I don't get it. But all right. I'll play ya. Let's light it
BJ,And us.
Tenho,"Def Märch forëver, baby."
777,"Heh. Sorry, kid."
Shooter,Agh...
777,"I'll let ya try again, though. Any time ya feel up to it."
777,You up for Tin Pin?
Shooter,Better believe I am!
777,"Oh, I believe it. Let's go."
Shooter,I won!
777,"You're pretty good, kid. Here ya go. And you two? Whatever your deal is, "
Beat,......
Shiki,"Whew... We got away. That was pretty close, huh? If things look grim, "
Shiki,"Hey, um... Aren't we, you know... running a LOT lately? I mean, "
Neku,......
Shiki,"Let's stand our ground when we can, OK?"
Neku,...... Fine.
Shiki,Neku! Stop running all the time!
Neku,What's wrong with running?
Shiki,You're holding us back! What happens if we get a mission where we have
Neku,......
Shiki,...You hear me? Ugh! You are such a chicken. Buck buck buck buck buck
Shiki,...... ...... ......
Neku,(This is awkward...)
Joshua,"Oh, we're running? You didn't seem the type."
Neku,......
Joshua,"Well, I suppose it's inevitable... sometimes. Hee hee..."
Neku,(I suppose you're an ass. All the time.)
Joshua,"Oh, Neku? We seem to be running away an awful lot."
Neku,Are not.
Joshua,Wait-- don't tell me you're struggling with combat! In your second
Neku,......
Joshua,"I know how capable you are, so I won't say another word. Hee hee..."
Neku,(Rrgh! Must...not... strangle!)
Joshua,......
Neku,What?
Joshua,......
Neku,...WHAT? Just say it!
Joshua,"...... ...... ...... Well, you're awfully..."
Neku,What?
Joshua,...... ...... Hmm.
Neku,(You know what? Bite me!)
Beat,"Yo, whatchu runnin' for, man?"
Neku,Why waste energy?
Beat,Hmph. Aight then. But next time we stay an' fight.
Beat,"Yo, yo, what the hell!? Why you keep runnin'?"
Neku,Strategy. That's what you call a tactical retreat.
Beat,Oh yeah? Well... He who stays an' fights away lives today another 
Neku,...... Um. No... I don't think that's how it goes.
Beat,Whatever! As long as we on the offense! We gotta conquer us... some...
Beat,Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo! NO! Men don't run! Men fight! Where your
Neku,"I told you, I'm being strategic."
Beat,"You'll never survive like that, yo!"
Neku,...... I'm sorry-- that sounded like worry.
Beat,Wha-- N...no! I don't care 'bout you! Hells no!
Neku,...... (Good.)
Neku,Talk about your sketchy stores...
Seller,"Hey, kids? Um... Look around if you want, but... I ain't sellin'."
Neku,Huh?
Seller,"The stuff in the case? It's special to me. So, like, if you want it?"
Neku,...... Then take it out of the damn case.
Shiki,"Neku. Let's just browse, OK?"
Seller,"That fuse? Sorry, ain't sellin'. That baby's custom-made. So, like..."
Seller,"The cough drops? Sorry, ain't sellin'. You can't buy those in just "
Seller,"The dandy hat? Sorry, ain't sellin'. I mean, look at you. Aren't you"
Seller,"""Love in a Heartbeat""? Sorry, ain't sellin'. And for the record: it's"
Shiki,!
Seller,"What? You're not together? You young people, heh."
Neku,You heard the man.
Seller,I ain't sellin'.
Neku,Let's go.
Seller,I ain't sellin'.
Shiki,"Easy, Neku. Let's just browse a bit."
Shiki,Neku! Your phone!
Neku,A meme?
Doi,"Sigh... Another day with no sales... I know my ramen looks plain, "
Shiki,Neku! Your Phone!
Neku,A meme?
Techie,(! ...Cough drops?) Cough drops! Yeah! 777's always 
Techie,I have to hurry! [leaves]
Neku,And away he goes.
Shiki,Maybe he'll buy the part now. Or maybe he won't... We'd better follow
Shiki,Look! He just went inside.
Neku,Let's move.
Techie,"...OK, cough drops: check. But...I get the feeling I'm forgetting"
Shiki,"Neku, try another meme."
Neku,Like some kind of part for repairs?
Techie,It's no good. I keep thinking... and I keep drawing a blank.
Techie,I know I'm supposed to pick something up. What WAS it? I
Techie,"(Until I left this morning,)"
Techie,"(I was setting up the stage, right? Mics were set. "
Techie,(! ...Ramen?) Actually... I am kinda hungry. Yeah... I stopped for
Shiki,Neku! There he is! He's not buying the part! He's...he's... eating?
Doi,There y'are! The Ramen Don special!
Techie,Wait...
Ken,Eat up before it gets cold!
Techie,"Wait just a sec... ! Oh, crap! I'm supposed to be picking up that "
Ken,"Wait! Sir, your noodles! Sigh... I can't win. Young people just won't "
Shiki,Neku! After him!
Techie,It's no good. I keep thinking... and I keep drawing a blank.
Techie,"(Until I left this morning,)"
Techie,(! ...Blackout?) Yeah! I need to fix the lighting. The guy told me to
Techie,It's no good. I keep thinking... and I keep drawing a blank.
Techie,"(Until I left this morning,)"
Techie,(! ...Cough drops?) I bought the cough drops. All set with those. 
Techie,It's no good. I keep thinking... and I keep drawing a blank.
Techie,"(Until I left this morning,)"
Techie,"(! ...Ramen?) No, no, no. Definitely not. Why do I keep thinking "
Techie,I-I-I will! But first--
777,What now?
Techie,[hands over the cough drops] I thought you could use these before the
777,Cough drops?
Techie,I've really been looking forward to your concert!
777,"...... [takes the cough drops] ...Go on, get outta here."
Techie,Right!
777,Hey!
Techie,Y-yeah?
777,"Let's make rock history, man."
Techie,Y-you know it! [leaves]
Shiki,"Good thing he picked those up, huh? And now we have light!"
Neku,Finally we can see inside.
777,Hey! Thanks for everything. Here. For you. It's Def March band swag. One
Shiki,Ooh! Thanks!
777,I better see you at the show. Later!
Shiki,All right! Let's finish this mission.
Neku,Right!
Mina,"How's work going, Makoto?"
Makoto,Bad. The boss wants me to promote some new pins. But how? I don't 
Mina,Sounds rough.
Makoto,"Yeah. I've been trying to study up. Like, people use pins to play Tin"
Mina,"The Tin Pin slam-off, huh... If you had a ticket, you'd go?"
Makoto,Uh-huh.
Mina,Hmm...
Ai,Huh? Isn't that... ......
Ai,Hey...Mina? Where were you yesterday?
Mina,Yesterday? Ahh...umm... Ten-Fou! Yeah... The Prince was there for a

Yammer,The grand prize is a Hero Pin!? Dude! Those are sooo rare!
Shiki,Slam-off? What's that?
Neku,Check the poster.
Shiki,"""Tin Pin Slammer Super Slam-off!!! Mighty warriorrs, slam forth!"" Ohh."
Neku,"Tin Pin Slammer, huh... (Just some stupid game.)"
Shiki,Hmm... It's some kind of divination. I think you have to move the coin
man,Whoa!
man,Nuh-uh!
man,It moved!
man,...Huh?
man,It's not moving.
man,...Nothing.
man,Hellooo?
man,So quick! So decisive! That's my Reaper! Marvelous! ? ...Huh?
man,"So quick! So decisive! Thadda boy, Creepy! Marvelous! "
Neku,This guy is pissing me off.
Shiki,"Just try moving it more slowly, OK? Apparently that's more convincing."
man,Is it [Black/White/the Gate]!?
man,...not [Black/White/the Gate].
Mina,"I'm serious! Ai, please..."
Ai,Uh-huh. I believe you.
Mina,Arrgh. No you don't. Come on...
Ai,It's OK. I know.
Mina,What!?
Ai,...How you feel.
Mina,(Shoot! She's so onto me! Now what? Do I just tell her?
Mina,(! ...The tickets. Hmm... Maybe I really should tell her. But
Mina,(! ...Reaper Creeper? That magic game people use to get

Mina,It moved!
Mina,Wow!
Mina,Cool...
Mina,...Hmm. No response.
Mina,"Oh, Reaper?"
Mina,"Move, darn it!"
Mina,"WHOA! Did you see that coin fly? Cool! ! But... Wait. Ai, did you move"
Ai,N...no!
Mina,"Heh heh, I'm kidding. We probably just shook the paper. Let's try one"
Neku,Am I really moving it that fast?
Shiki,Try doing it more slooowly. We ladies require a delicate touch.
Mina,[Black/White/The Gate]?
Mina,Oh! Not [Black/White/the Gate]...
Mina,"Black! Cool... The coin really moved! So, like... We said, ""if you're"
Ai,That's right. And they can
Mina,"The Gate! Cool... The coin really moved! So, like... We said, ""if "
Ai,That's right. And they can
Ai,There it goes...
Ai,(It's gonna be White.)
Ai,(Just watch.)
Ai,Nothing...
Ai,"Come on, Reaper."
Ai,Answer the question!
Ai,Waaah! Hey!!! Mina! Don't move the paper!
Mina,I... I didn't!
Ai,"Yeah, right. You can't fool me!"
Mina,Hey...Ai... What's gotten into you?
Ai,REAPER. CREEPER.
Ai,I knew it
Ai,...What? [Black/The Gate]?
Ai,Oh! Not [Black/White/the Gate]...
Ai,Black? WHAT!?
Mina,"Um, Ai--"
Ai,(Black means NO. But that can't be true. I saw her with him yesterday. 
Mina,Ai... This isn't like 
Ai,The Gate? What is THAT!?
Mina,"Um, Ai--"
Ai,"(The Gate means ""neither."" That makes zero sense! Whatever, I know she's"
Mina,Ai... This isn't like 
Ai,HEY!!! Mina! Stop moving the paper!
Mina,I... I didn't!
Ai,Stop interfering! This is IMPORTANT!
Mina,"Ahh... Please, Ai... You're scaring me. Snap out of it..."
Ai,REAPER. CREEPER.
Ai,Why is it Black!?
Mina,Please... Ai!
Ai,The Reaper is lying! I saw you!
Mina,...What?]
Ai,"...The Gate? That's ridiculous! Quit messing around, Reaper!!!"
Mina,Please... Ai!
Ai,I know the truth. I saw you!
Mina,...What?]
Reaper,"...... ...Huh? 'Sup, Players. Want me to clear the wall? Hmm... Then"
Reaper,...Wait. You already did!? Uhh... Then I guess you can just
Reaper,"You kids know about the pig indicator? If the icon's lit up, there's"
Reaper,"...... Oh, huh! Got 'em already? You're pretty good! ...... So..."
Reaper,"...... ...Huh? 'Sup, Players. Want me to clear the wall? First, bring"
Reaper,"...Hey, wow. I'm kind of impressed. You can pass."
Makoto,The...the book! In my book it said--
Sota,"Stop mumbling, loser!"
Makoto,Eep! I...I was just... Nothing! Never mind!
Neku,"Ooh, we're off to a great start. (I should use imprinting and help him"
Makoto,"(Huh? Oh, no! What's my line? I totally forgot... Totally..."

Makoto,(Who...who is this kid!? I can't get a word in! What should I say?
Makoto,! Totally gnarly!
Shooter,WHOAAA!!!
Makoto,Huh?
Shooter,Bro! Where's your Solid Slammer?
Makoto,T-totally gnarly!

Makoto,Hot stuff!
Shooter,Whoa! BRO!!!

Shooter,"If you loan me a Slammurai DVD, I'll let you join my forces of slam."
Makoto,Um...sure.
Makoto,Ahem... Who dropped all this MONEY? ...... Darn. There goes Plan B.

Reaper,"...... ...Huh? 'Sup, Players. Want me to clear the wall? First, bring"
Reaper,"...Hey, wow, I'm kind of impressed. You can pass."
Reaper,"...... Like a bolt from the blue, it's time for the Reaper Review."
Reaper,"Hmm, you don't say... Question 2! They sell a pin there called Happy"
Reaper,"Well, aren't you so smart? Question 3! OK, another item they stock..."
Reaper,"Hmm, you sure about that? OK... The results are in! Reaper Review,"
Reaper,You pass! So pass on through. [wall goes down] But! Though you may
Reaper,Bzzzt! So sorry! I can't let you pass-- until you pass.

Joshua,...You're speaking to me?
Reaper,That's right. Come back wearing head-to-toe Natural Puppy threads. Do
Joshua,Satisfied?
Reaper,"Wow... You actually kinda work that. Pretty brave, kid. But-- I'm not"
Neku,! Huh? The wall's gone...
Joshua,I'm sure one of the other Players probably cleared it. You are aware
Neku,"Yes, I realized, thank you. (Kiss my ass, Josh.)"
Joshua,"Sigh... We could be letting them do the entire mission, but nooo..."
Neku,...... You done?
Neku,What? I... I lost?
Yammer,"Heh heh! Did you really think you could win? Look at your pins, bro!"
Joshua,"Everyone knows you should mod your pins, Neku."
Neku,M-mod them?
Joshua,"Although, if you get carried away..."
Announcer,"Due to prohibited alterations to the pins used in the last match,"
Yammer,What!?
Joshua,That's my Neku. You're one lucky dog.
Neku,"...I won. Whew, I'm safe."
Yammer,"Rrgh! Can't believe I'm out on a DQ... Still, you're history next"
Neku,And why is that?
Yammer,You're facing the top seed. It's over.
Neku,"The top seed, huh..."
Joshua,Dumb luck will only get you so far.
Man,Please! It's our hour of need here!
Neku,(What's his deal?)
H,How many hours of need does this make? You fed me the same line last
Man,But it's the truth!
Neku,A customer? That'd be a change.
Joshua,He's back again?
Neku,Sounds like serious business. We should probably come back later.
Shooter,Where'd he disappear to after he beat me? I want a rematch...
Yammer,"Sucks what happened yesterday. I thought you had it in the bag,"
Shooter,"Yeah... The bro in the headphones took off, too. What was the big"
Joshua,"Hee hee... Sounds like you have a fan, Neku."
Neku,......
Reaper,Ugh... This sucks. Why should we have to do this?
Neku,!
Joshua,Those two are...
Neku,Reapers!?
Reaper,What's the GM thinkin' when he makes this stuff? I really
Reaper,"Don't ask me, man... Nobody can ever really tell what he's "
Reaper,No joke. If he sees us hauling his baby off... our asses
Reaper,Getting stuck in the middle of those two bites.
Neku,......
Joshua,Looks like they're carting off that trash heap. At the rate they're
Neku,"Well, let's leave them to it."
Joshua,"The tracker's responding here, but... I don't think it's what we're"
Neku,......
Neku,Another junk pile... The Grim Heaper strikes again?
Joshua,Know anyone else who'd put something like this together?
Neku,? ...There's something written on it.
Neku,...... Uhh... what?
Joshua,I think he's saying he's better than gravity?
Neku,...... Uh...huh.
Joshua,"The tracker's responding here, but... I don't think it's what we're"
Neku,......
Uzuki,AAAGH!
Kariya,"That's Kariya six, Uzuki zerooo."
Uzuki,One more! I can still make a comeback!
Neku,What the...
Joshua,Reapers!?
Neku,Are they fighting?
Kariya,This Tin Pin thing's pretty deep. ...Maybe too deep for you?
Uzuki,"Shut up and play! And, slaaam..."
Neku,Tin Pin Slammer!?
Joshua,They must be bored.
Uzuki,"Wait a... You again? Who plays the Game twice? Anyway, I'd love to "
Neku,Hands off? What's that supposed to mean?
Kariya,"Orders, straight from the top. Game Master says nobody touches the"
Neku,"But, wait. Why would he--"
Uzuki,"I wish I knew! [beep] ! ...Hmm? Ugh, phone. One sec. Yashiro here."
end,I-I like...
Uzuki,"What? Speak up! Is this a crank call? Ugh, who in the hell? OK, that "
Neku,Why call all the Reapers off? What's he thinking? ...I don't get it.
Joshua,"Who knows? With his ego, he probably wants to play this Game solo."
Neku,Wouldn't surprise me.
Joshua,"Anyway, the signal's weaker here. Let's try another spot."
Neku,......
Reaper,"Like a bolt from the blue... It's time for a Tin Pin lesson, from me "
Reaper,Right. Every good lesson starts with the basics. [tutorial screen]
Reaper,"Yeah, who doesn't love whammies? I do. [tutorial screen]"
Reaper,Here's what whammies can do... for YOU. [tutorial screen]
Reaper,So many pins! How do you decide which ones to slam with? [tutorial
Reaper,"Now you're ready to slam with the best. Perhaps another day, you may"
Neku,...... (Who is this guy?)
Shooter,AHH! The bro in the headphones!
Neku,"(You're... Oh, right, from yesterday.)"
Joshua,Thanks for all your help.
Yammer,"Huh? Shooter, do you know these guys?"
Shooter,YEAH! I explained Tin Pin to 'em!
Yammer,Ouch... And they understood?
Joshua,"You played Neku in the first round, right?"
Shooter,"And lost! Right, Yammer?"
Yammer,I-I was having an off day! Today's a different story! I retooled my
Shooter,I smell a REMATCH!
Yammer,Heh... You think you can take me? 'Cause I don't think you can take 
Joshua,"Aww, you have fans, Neku. Why not indulge them?"
Neku,......
Yammer,"Aww, man... I just modded my pins, too..."
Joshua,Here to play a round with the boys?
Yammer,All right! Here I come!
Neku,Ugh...
Yammer,"Heh heh. You can't beat a Yammer special, man. My pins pwn."
Neku,No freaking joke! What was with those?
Shooter,"Yeah, but how much did you tweak those, Yammer?"
Yammer,Wh-what? Don't give me that look! My mods are all legal! 
Yammer,Rrgh! But my pins... That design should've been perfect! I tweaked 
Neku,"(So basically, he was cheating...)"
Shooter,"You can't keep counting on mods, Yammer! They only get you so far!"
Yammer,"But I... No, you're right, Shooter. Here. You can have this pin. I "
Neku,Um...OK? Thanks.
Mina,"Ooh, so how was yesterday? You went to the slam-off, right?"
Ai,"Sort of... I mean, we went, but... Makoto says he's outgrown Tin Pin"
Mina,What? That sucks!
Ai,He's like a totally different person lately. I..I wonder if it's 
Mina,"It's not your fault, Ai! Don't beat yourself up."
Ai,Thanks...
Mina,Hey! How about some ramen? A new place opened up on Dogenzaka! The 
Ai,"OK...sure. Thanks, Mina."
Neku,"A new ramen place, huh?"
Joshua,"Mmm, ramen. I'm a shio guy, myself. Plain and simple. How about you,"
Neku,"Hmm... I dunno, shoyu?"
Joshua,Hmm... Not very imaginative.
Neku,"(Well, excuse me!)"
Neku,"Eh, I'd say miso."
Joshua,Interesting... ......
Neku,......
Joshua,......
Neku,(...What!?)
Neku,"Yeah, probably shio."
Joshua,"My, my. We're twins. It must be fate."
Neku,...Ugh.
Neku,I like tonkotsu.
Joshua,Hmm... Very hip.
Neku,(...I guess?)
Reaper,"...... Guess who! Like a bolt from the blue, it's time for the Reaper"
coffee,WildKat. Which of the following will you
Reaper,Really? Question 2! I left my heard in Shibuya's phone booth of love!
Reaper,Is that your final answer? Question 3! Let's change up the flavor a

Reaper,Bzzzt! So sorry! I can't let you pass-- until you pass.
Reaper,"...... Did you do your homework, kids? Then away we go!"
Reaper,You pass! So pass on through. [wall goes down] But! Though you may
Joshua,"Wait, Neku. The signal's getting weaker."
Neku,So we're going the wrong way?
Joshua,Let's try another spot.
Neku,Well?
Joshua,Hmm... The signal's pretty weak. Looks like we're headed 
Reaper,"...... ...Huh? 'Sup, Players. Want me to clear the wall? First, bring"
Reaper,"...Hey, wow. I'm kind of impressed. You can pass. ! Oh, and here. I"
Techie,"Man, I'm starved... Ooh, what was that I saw on the Prince's blog?"
Joshua,"Ah, yes... The spicy tuna roll. It's a kind of sushi they serve "
Neku,So what's in it?
Joshua,"Tuna paired with a spicy sauce, then rolled up."
Neku,Crazy.
Joshua,"Think sushi, with a kick."
Neku,Is it any good?
Joshua,I'm a fan.
Shooter,"Hey, Yammer! Did you catch yesterday's show?"
Yammer,Of course!
Shooter,"Man, ""Slammurai"" is the BEST!"
Yammer,It's really heating up towards the end!
Shooter,I knew Dead was hiding something from his past.
Yammer,Totally! Why would Black show up there... unless he and Yellow are
Shooter,I can't WAIT for next week! Plus the movie comes out in a month. I'm
Neku,...What?
Joshua,"It's a kid's show, Tin Pin Slammurai. It's very popular."
Neku,Uh...huh.
Joshua,"The leader, Dead, is locked in a duel with his rival, Black-- at "
Neku,(...My partner watches kiddie TV.)
Mina,"! Hey, c'mon, wait your turn..."
Joshua,I just have a few quick questions. Do you mind?
Neku,"(Wow, he cuts right to the chase...)"
Mina,"Huh? About what? I'm here with a friend, so keep it short, OK?"
Joshua,Why do you like the ramen here so much?
Mina,"Why? Uh, 'cause it's the most popular spot in Shibuya?"
Neku,(She likes it because it's popular?)
Mina,"And it's fun, don't you think? Where else do they dance while making "
Neku,(And that has what to do with the ramen?)
Mina,"Plus, they gave me this cool limited-edition pin. How could anyone NOT"
Joshua,"But it's pretty new, right? How did it get this big this fast?"
Mina,"The Prince wrote about it on his blog. I mean, he F'd it! How can I"
Joshua,I see...
Neku,So how's it taste? Good?
Mina,"Totally! The Prince said it was great. For 5,000 yen, it must be. Just"
Neku,(It's got a friggin' steak on it...)
Joshua,So where else do you go for ramen?
Mina,"Huh? For ramen? Umm... I dunno, noodles aren't really my thing. I "
Neku,(Then what the hell are you doing here?)
Mina,"Ooh! That said... It'd be awesome to see, like, a dessert ramen!"
Neku,Dessert...ramen?
Mina,"Yeah! Like, all fruity and sweet!"
Joshua,A tantalizing possibility.
Neku,......
Joshua,"Well, thanks. That was informative."
Mina,"OK. I'm gonna go eat, then."
Joshua,"All right, then. Let's head out."
Ken,I need to outsell that sorry excuse for a ramen shop... I need...
Ken,"Ugh, it's no use... Nothing's coming to me. So close, but..."
Ken,"(Hmm, what would the kids like?)"
Ken,(What's hip? I need... something.
Ken,"! Yes! That's it! ...... Wait, no... That won't work."
Ken,! Yes! That's it! [leaves]
Ken,"Oh! Perfect timing, boys! I'm trying out a new idea. Have a taste! I "
Neku,(Unreal...)
Joshua,......
Neku,......
Joshua,Mmm ? Very tasty!
Neku,Yeah... This is pretty good!
Joshua,"Kudos, mister! Still... It's missing something."
Ken,"Hrm... Yeah... I thought so, too. These silly experiments won't solve"
Joshua,"Hey, now..."
Neku,"That's messed up. The ramen here is awesome, and nobody notices. But"
Joshua,"Welcome to capitalism, Neku."
Neku,But why are they all up on that place? They don't even like the food.
Joshua,It's a conversation piece. People are always scrounging for something
Neku,"Ugh, they're sheep!"
Joshua,Maybe all of Shibuya is.
Ken,"Gah ha ha... Well, thanks anyway, boys. But I'm not giving up yet. I'll"
Ken,! Yes! That's it!
Ken,"Oh! Perfect timing, boys! I'm trying out a new idea. Have a taste! I "
Neku,(Unreal...)
Joshua,......
Neku,......
Joshua,Mmm ? Dee-lish!
Neku,"Yeah, this hits the spot."
Joshua,"Kudos, mister! Still... it's missing something."
Ken,"Hrm... Yeah... I thought so, too. But I'm not giving up yet. I'll keep"
Reaper,"...... ...Huh? 'Sup, Players. Want me to clear the wall? Hmm... Let's"
Reaper,"...... Daaamn, man! Didn't think you'd actually do it. Wall clear. So"
Neku,! Look who.
Uzuki,"We've been looking forever, and still nothing!"
Kariya,"Chill out, Uzuki. Slow and steady, girl."
Uzuki,Are you kidding!? This is a direct order from Ms. Konishi! Don't you
Joshua,You actually look busy today.
Uzuki,"Very busy, thank you. We certainly don't have any time to waste on "
Kariya,Aight. Whatever...
Neku,"(Hmm, wonder what they were looking for.)"
Joshua,The signal's getting weak. Let's try someplace else.
Neku,......
Neku,Another junk pile... The Grim Heaper strikes again?
Joshua,Know anyone else who'd put something like this together?
Neku,? ...There's something written on it.
Neku,"...... Uhh... what? First of all, sounds don't really shake anything..."
Joshua,I think he's saying he's better than air.
Neku,...... Uh...huh.
Joshua,"The tracker's responding here, but... I don't think it's what we're"
Neku,......
Shooter,"HEY, BRO! You slammin'?"
Joshua,Here to play a round with Shooter?
Shooter,"Aww, but bro..."
Shooter,AWRIGHT! Let's do this!
Shooter,Heh! You've got a ways to go.
Neku,Rrgh...
Shooter,I'm up for a rematch! Any time you want!
Shooter,"WOW, bro! You're getting good!"
Yammer,I can't believe you beat Shooter!
Shooter,I let him win. I thought it'd be mean to crush him!
Neku,(You little...)
Shooter,"Still, bro, that was NICE! Take this."
Joshua,Care to see those shots again?
Joshua,It's empty.
Neku,So the mic wasn't there yet.
Joshua,That's their microphone.
Neku,? Huh? What's that black thing on the phone?
Joshua,Looks like a cell.
Neku,Why bother with a pay phone if you've got a cell?
Neku,"That's BJ, right?"
Joshua,It would seem so.
Neku,What was he doing here?
Joshua,He may tell us if we show him this picture.
Joshua,"We still have questioning to do. The one in black, BJ, is "
Joshua,"We still have questioning to do. The one in black, BJ, is "
Joshua,Where were you yesterday at 2:00?
BJ,"! Oh, uh... I was... You know, uhh ...Dogenzaka! Yeah! In line for the "
Neku,"(Not the subtlest guy, huh?)"
Joshua,Mm-hmm...
BJ,"Wh-what? Just gimme some space, would ya? I want to spend some time "
Joshua,"Hee hee. Somehow, I doubt his story."
Neku,"Yeah, he's hiding something. Still--"
Joshua,It'll take hard evidence to get him to fess up. ...So let's go find
Joshua,"Hmmm, BJ's still not talking. Looks like it'll take a bit"
Neku,He's definitely hiding something.
Joshua,All right. Let's go check out the scene.
Neku,What scene?
Joshua,The scene of the crime-- the one spot BJ swears he hasn't
Joshua,Hee hee... BJ can clam up all he likes. This photo is bound
Neku,...... (Is it weird that I feel like the bad guy here?)
Joshua,We've taken care of BJ.
Neku,Poor guy.
Joshua,That leaves Tenho.
Neku,I didn't see him back at Molco.
Joshua,He can't have gone too far. Let's check the adjoining 
Joshua,We've been to the scene and talked to BJ. That leaves...
777,Well? Any luck?
Neku,Not yet...
777,Ugh... Guess it's time to call the cops.
Neku,(Some Reaper you are...)
TV,Feeling pinned? Break down those boundaries. RED SKULL.
Neku,"! Hey, it's that commercial..."
person,"Ooh! Ooh! Look, it's playing!"
2,That CAT pin is phat!
Person,You can't find that pin anywhere!
Neku,It's really taken off... Even folks who seem like they wouldn't be into
Joshua,Like the guy handing them out at the ramen place. Looks like 
Neku,Shiki and I were pretty thorough.
Joshua,"...... Looks an awful lot like the Player Pin, hmm?"
Neku,"...... So who makes the Player Pins, anyway? The Reapers?"
Joshua,Nope. That's Composer territory. He's responsible for creating and
Neku,The Composer... The guy in charge of Shibuya?
Joshua,Correct. We're in the Composer's Game. The Reapers are just his
Neku,Some designer. His Game royally sucks.
Joshua,Hee hee... Doesn't it?
Neku,...... Can he and his Reapers go to the RG?
Joshua,"RG, UG-- it's all the same Shibuya. Just, people in the RG can't see "
Neku,"So they have wings here, but not in the RG?"
Joshua,Apparently a Reaper's wings house his power.
Neku,So they're basically just normal people in the RG... ...... (So the
Joshua,"Hmm? Something wrong, Neku?"
Neku,No. I'm fine.
777,...... There's nothing there
Neku,Huh?
Joshua,Neku... Wrong photo.
BJ,You jerkin' us around?
Tenho,Proof my ass...
Joshua,"Really, Neku. Stop fooling around."
Neku,Hrm...
777,That's our mic! It was in the phone booth by Molco? But I looked 
BJ,You jerkin' us around? That photo doesn't show anybody!
Joshua,Ahem... Neku? Wrong photo.
Shooter,"HEY, BRO! You slammin'?"
Joshua,Here to play a round with Shooter?
Shooter,"Aww, but bro..."
Shooter,"HEY, BRO! You slammin'?"
Joshua,Here to play a round with the boys?
Shooter,AWRIGHT! Let's do this! [Play Tin Pin]
Shooter,Heh! You've got a ways to go.
Neku,Rrgh...
Shooter,But I'll replay you any time!
Shooter,I... I lost? ...... You're getting good at this.
Yammer,Heh heh... I hand-design and build all my pin mods. It's Yammer Time!
Yammer,Heh heh. The Yammer special pwns!
Neku,Rrgh...
Yammer,"Nooo! That design should've been perfect! I totally retooled my pins,"
Neku,(He cheated AGAIN?)
Beat,!
Neku,"A wall, huh? Guess we're not going this way."
Beat,"Dammit. I can't break this one. Le's try a different way, yo!"
Beat,"No sign of the pops. Yo, you think he came this way?"
Uzuki,Tee hee!
Neku,"Hey, wasn't that... What's she doing?"
Beat,"Hey! Phones! Focus, man. The guy ain't here. We gotta check someplace"
Beat,"The Reaper Creeper guy ain't down this way, man."
Neku,Let's head back and check someplace else.
Makoto,Sigh... What am I gonna do?
Neku,Hey... I know him.
Makoto,Nothing I do ever works out. I give up...
Prince,"Huh? Hey, Mick."
Makoto,"Oh. Eiji... I-I mean, Mr. Oji."
Prince,What's wrong? You look down.
Makoto,...... I'm a chronic failure. I left my job 'cause I thought I had 
Prince,What have you been doing with the ramen place?
Makoto,I closed it down for a while.
Prince,What? Why!? The place was packed.
Makoto,"At first. Then sales started to tumble, and I had no idea how to keep"
Prince,"...... Mick, we had this talk before. The trends can make and break "
Makoto,"Yeah, I remember. ""Be more trendy."" Is that it?"
Prince,"No, it's not that simple. You can't just throw on a popular outfit "
Makoto,...... OK. I think I get it...
Prince,"Well, I gotta get to my next appointment. See you, Mick."
Makoto,Wear what feels right... DO what feels right... Aww... But what feels
Reaper,"...... Like a bolt from the blue... No, this time I mean it-- I'm "
Reaper,Moving on... Question 2! Been mingling much? The pins you're wearing
Reaper,"This is it! Question 3! Shibuya's got a fever, and the only"
Reaper,"It's over! OK... The results are in! Reaper Review, our final lesson!"
Reaper,Bzzt! So sorry! I can't let you pass-- until you pass. 
Reaper,"...... Did you do your homework, kids? Then away we go!"
Reaper,"You pass! So pass on through. I'd say, ""See you in the next life,"""
Neku,All right. Let's see where this takes us.
Guy,Reaper... Creeper...
Beat,"Get ready to answer his question. An' remember: White is YES, black is"
Guy,What should Makoto do with his future?
Neku,Huh!? That's not a yes-or-no question!
Guy,"Please, Reaper! Show me the way!"
Beat,"Yo, just wing it, Phones!"
Neku,......
Guy,What should Makoto do with his future.
Beat,"Yo, I dunno if White or Black matters, so just pick one and"
Guy,...Huh? It's not moving. Hellooo? ...Nothing.
Guy,It moved! Gaaaaah! So quick! So decisive! That's my
Guy,"So quick! So decisive! Thadda boy, Creepy! Marvelous!"
Neku,This guy is pissing me off.
Beat,"Yo, you suck at this, Phones... Move it slooowly."
Guy,It moved! Whoa! Nuh-uh!
Guy,Is it Black?
Guy,...Not Black.
Guy,The Gate!?
Guy,...Not the Gate.
Guy,Is it White!?
Guy,...Not White.
Guy,"Black! An answer, clear as day! Nothing beats Reaper Creeper "
Guy,"Red! An answer, clear as day! Nothing beats Reaper"
Guy,"White! An answer, clear as day! Nothing beats Reaper"
Neku,...... It...it does!?
Guy,"All right, Makoto. I think I have your answer."
Makoto,"Um, Boss, who were you talking to?"
Guy,I know you think your luck's dried up.
Makoto,Yeah... Nothing's going my way.
Guy,"Well, that's because... you need more BLACK in your life!"
Guy,"Well, that's because... you need more RED in your "
Guy,"Well, that's because... you need more WHITE in your"
Makoto,What?
Guy,You heard me. Black! More darkness! More mystery!
Guy,You heard me. Red! More... moulin rouge!
Guy,You heard me. White! More pure-as-the-drive-
Makoto,Uh...uhmm...
Guy,And I have just the product for you.
Makoto,"But... Boss, I--"
Guy,"I had to pull a few strings to get these, so--"
Makoto,"Boss, I... I have to run. Take care..."
Guy,"W-wait, Makoto!"
Guy,You forgot your BLACK!
Guy,You forgot your RED!
Guy,You forgot your BLACK!
Neku,......
Beat,"You see that? Mission cleared, yo!"
Neku,......
Beat,"Game over, Pinky! Come on out!"
Neku,......
Beat,"What, ain't she here? Wait a minute... Yo, did she trick us? Or maybe "
Neku,......
